 Self-harm is difficult to talk about but it's a common problem and you can beat it. Find out what self-harm means and what to do if you think you're affected by it.

 What is self-harm?
 
 Self-harm is when you hurt yourself on purpose. You usually do it because something else feels wrong. It seems like the only way to let those feelings out.
 
 It is a very common behaviour in young people and affects around one in 12 people, with 10% of 15-16 year olds self-harming.
 
 If you self-harm, it is usually as a result of another problem. It can happen if you are feeling anxious, depressed, stressed or bullied and feel you don't have any other way of dealing with these issues.
 
 Often self-harming brings only temporary relief. It can be upsetting when you think that self-harm is the only way you can cope, but there are other healthy ways you can cope.
 
 Sometimes it feels like no one understands why you self-harm, but lots more people today know about what the condition really means.
 
 What to do about self-harm?
 
 Take the first step.
 
 If you think you are affected by self-harm, talk to someone - a parent or relative you trust, perhaps a teacher or youth worker. If you don't think you can confide in anyone, talk to your GP.
 
 Why talk to your GP?
 
 Self-harm can be a sign of other disorders that you need help with - such as depression or anxiety - and they can refer you to the right people for treatment. You may also be referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) so you can have an assessment for the right treatment for you.
 
 Guide To CAMHS
 
 Treating Injuries
 
 You may well need treatment quickly for injuries from self-harming. Any injuries you have should be treated straight away and not left because you harmed yourself.
 
 Your GP may be able to treat the injuries themself or may refer you to hospital where you will be treated by a doctor or nurse trained to work with children and young people who self-harm.
 
 Stories about self-harm recovery
 
 Charlotte's blog: My story of self-harm recovery
 
 I was only 14 when I started to self-harm. I was never intending to hurt myself. I was doing it for the sense of relief it provided. I felt like the only way I could function and leave my room was if I had that release.
 
 One day my father walked in on me when I was self-harming. I thought, ""This is it, I am in so much trouble and I'll be grounded."" On another level I felt so worried about upsetting my father, he meant so much to me. To my surprise he just sat next to me, calmed me down and told me to be safe. He then got me scar oil in case I wanted it - which was so thoughtful.
 
 I am now 22 and haven't self-harmed for over a year. So, how did I recover from self-harm?
 
 * I talk to people - because I know that there is no shame in my feelings or my past.
 
 * I never overwhelm myself and take one day at a time - knowing your limits is important.
 
 Looking back, for a long time I had suffered alone and didn't realise I could ask for help. So my message to you would be: don't let fear prevent you from getting the support you deserve.

 What are suicidal feelings?
 
 You might be feeling down and sad. But if those feelings have become very deep and intense, and you don't know what to do about them, you might think the only solution is to end your life. But there is hope for you, and you can get through it.
 
 You're not the only one who feels this way - many people feel suicidal at some time in their lives. What's important for you to know is that there are lots of ways of dealing with this feeling and overcoming it. It's possible to come out the other side and feel okay again.
 
 You might experience suicidal feelings if you:
 
 * are depressed or have another mental illness
 
 * struggle with low self-esteem
 
 * use drugs or alcohol, especially when you're upset
 
 * feel anxious about pressures you face today or in the future
 
 * feel under pressure from family or your peers
 
 These feelings can get in the way of everything else - so much that you might find it hard to believe that you can feel better. But you can, whatever the problem is.
 
 What to do about feeling suicidal
 
 It can be hard to talk about your feelings. But sharing your worries with someone you trust can help you see your problems in a different way, and understand that suicide is not the only option.
 
 Here are some warning signs of suicidal feelings:
 
 * always talking or thinking about death
 
 * deep depression and sadness
 
 * losing interest in daily life
 
 * having increasing trouble sleeping and eating
 
 * feeling helpless or worthless
 
 * self-harming
 
 * feeling angry and that things can't change
 
 If you experience any of the symptoms above, please don't suffer in silence. You deserve help, and you will find that life is worth living.
 
 Lucas' story: I've got through suicidal feelings - so can you
 
 I started experiencing suicidal thoughts at a young age. I remember feeling very frightened about what was going on in my head; I really struggled to articulate how I was feeling. I didn't really talk to anyone and things slowly bottled up. I felt like a bottle of pop and every little thing shook that bottle until one day the lid flew off.
 
 I ended up going to hospital and saw the CAMHS crisis team there. I had a good chat with them and we formulated a crisis plan. After that, I had regular support from them and slowly realised the importance of talking. I ended up having a stay in an inpatient unit, where I received a diagnosis and a treatment plan. I also learnt coping strategies and overall learnt a lot about myself.
 
 This was a few years ago, and since that time I have completed my GCSEs and A-level equivalent and got good grades. I hit a lot of goals and I've made some amazing lifelong friends along the way, mainly from my local inclusive rugby team who also showed me the importance of men talking about their mental health. The team massively helped with my confidence and still does. It can be so helpful to have people who support you and, even if you don't feel like it sometimes, those people do exist for you.

 Ways to get help
 
 Take the first step and talk to someone you trust. If you've been thinking about ending your life, it's a good idea to talk to someone you trust, like a family member, friend, or teacher.
 
 If you don't feel like you can speak to anyone you know, there are confidential helplines like the Samaritans, and safe online forums like The Mix, where you can get support from trained people who care and want you to feel better. We have a list of helplines and services available to you at the bottom of the page.
 
 Speak to your GP and find out how to get help. This can be really daunting, but your GP will have heard from lots of people who are feeling like you are now. They will know what support and services are available in your local area. They can help you decide if medication like antidepressants might help you.

 How to support a friend who is feeling suicidal
 
 * Listen without judgement, stay calm and don't overreact. 
 
 * Be aware it's not your job to take away the pain or make it better. All you can do is be there, even if you don't know what to say.
 
 * Encourage them to open up and help them identify a trusted adult (such as a teacher) they could talk to and who can help them find support. Some young people may be reluctant to talk to a parent in case they 'freak out' or because the parent him/herself suffers from mental health problems.
 
 * Help them build up a wider support network so they know who to contact 24/7 if they're struggling, such as The Samaritans, Childline or the YoungMinds Crisis Messenger.
 
 * Make sure you talk to someone too. If you're trying to support a friend who's been thinking about suicide, that information can be a heavy burden to carry alone so share your feelings with someone you trust.

 What is depression?
 
 We all feel low or down at times, but if your negative emotions last a long time or feel very severe, you may have depression.
 
 Depression is a mood disorder where you feel very down all the time. Depression can happen as a reaction to something like abuse, bullying or family breakdown, but it can also run in families.
 
 Depression often develops alongside anxiety.
 
 It's not the same as manic depression, which is another term for bipolar disorder.
 
 Depression is one of the most common types of mental illness. Although it's hard to feel optimistic when you're depressed, there is lots of support available to help you feel better.
 
 ""Since I was a teenager I've been struggling with depression. Pulling me down, crushing my motivation, wasting my energy, hating myself, making me think life isn't worth living."" Daniel Howell, YouTuber and YoungMinds ambassador
 
 The symptoms of depression
 
 Depression affects different people in different ways. Symptoms can include:
 
 * not wanting to do things that you previously enjoyed
 
 * avoiding friends or social situations
 
 * sleeping more or less than normal
 
 * eating more or less than normal
 
 * feeling irritable, upset, miserable or lonely
 
 * being self-critical
 
 * feeling hopeless
 
 * maybe wanting to self-harm
 
 * feeling tired and not having any energy
 
 Just because you experience one or more of these symptoms, it doesn't mean you're definitely affected by depression. It's important to talk to your GP to get a full diagnosis.

 Why do you need help?
 
 Sometimes things can seem overwhelming, and you can feel you can't cope. You may simply just be having a bad day, or you may have an ongoing mental health problem that needs support. The important thing is not to try to cope on your own.
 
 When you're struggling it's not good to spend too much time alone, especially if you are feeling low and vulnerable. It's at times like these that you need to be able to talk to someone. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
 
 ""Know that you're not alone in this and people around you want to help you."" Bella Ramsey, actor and YoungMinds ambassador
 
 What's stopping you asking for help?
 
 You might not like asking for help. You may feel that you don't want to burden other people. You may worry about what they might think about you, or that they could tell other people. You may even be afraid that they'll laugh at you.
 
 But the truth is, people who care about you will want to help you. You just have to ask.
 
 Who can you ask for help?
 
 * your family - parents or carers, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles or cousins
 
 * trusted friends - your own friends, or friends of the family, neighbours
 
 * people you work with
 
 * professionals - your GP, a doctor or nurse, a social worker
 
 * a community support group, or online community
 
 Even if you're feeling completely alone right now and that you have nowhere to turn or that nobody cares, you are not alone. There are lots of amazing helplines and online services (listed at the bottom of this page) where you can get support from trained professionals who really do care and want to help you through it.

 Seren's story: Calling a mental health helpline
 
 The first time I rang a mental health helpline, I was 13 years old.
 
 I'd just moved across the country and started at a new school. A lot was happening with my family, and I was living in a brand-new city with someone I'd never even met before. It was a lot for anyone to cope with, and I remember one day locking myself in the bathroom and breaking down. I didn't feel like I had anyone around me who could help, so I braved a phone call to someone I'd never spoken to before: Samaritans.
 
 I can't remember too much about the call, but I do remember that I had never felt so heard and understood until that moment. I was bawling my eyes out, and the person on the end of the phone was warm, kind and patient. They lifted an enormous weight off me simply by being there for me in my moment of crisis.

 * The moment I reached out
 
 ""Talking has changed my life and my perspective of the world. It's taught me ways to cope and how to overcome my feelings.""
 
 Sometimes when you reach out for help, the person you talk to may not react the way you hoped they would or give you the positive support you need, which can be really difficult. But if that happens, their reaction is about them, not you. Not everyone will react in the same way. Please don't let this discourage you from reaching out again. Remember there are lots of other people who want to help you. You deserve help and support - don't forget that.
 
 How to ask for help
 
 Decide who is the best person to talk to. Who would you feel most comfortable talking to? Many of us prefer talking to family or friends, but you may prefer to talk to professionals, support groups, helplines or online discussion forums.
 
 Pick your time and place. Choose a good time and somewhere you feel comfortable, so you can talk uninterrupted in a relaxed environment.
 
 What outcome do you want? Do you simply want to be listened to? Would you like more practical or emotional support? It's okay if you don't know, but it can help to think about what you would like to achieve.
 
 Make notes. Write down the things you want to say so you remember to include them in your conversation. Or you could let the other person read your notes if talking is difficult.
 
 Explain how you feel and what support you would like. The other person will then have a better idea about how to try and help you.
 
 It may be difficult to talk about your feelings. But, as the saying goes, ""a problem shared is a problem halved,"" and you'll probably feel better simply for having talked to someone.
 
 When you're feeling down, it's important that you are not struggling on your own. There is lots of help and support available - you just have to reach out to get it.

41,1,"How to look after your mental health in later life
 
 One in five older people living in the community[1] and two in five people living in care homes[2] experience depression or poor mental health.
 
 Research shows that there are five key issues that can have an impact on the mental wellbeing of older people:[3]
 
 . Discrimination
 
 . Participation in meaningful activities
 
 . Relationships
 
 . Physical health
 
 . Poverty
 
 Even though there are laws in place to help with some of these issues - for instance, the Equality Act 2010 addresses age discrimination[4] - you may feel that you can't influence society-wide problems like pensioner poverty. However, as an individual, there is a lot you can do to protect your own mental wellbeing.
 
 Throughout this booklet, you can find references for where to get both help and advice.
 
 Read on for 10 practical ways to help you stay mentally well.
 
 1. Be prepared for changes
 
 Getting older and retirement both involve a change in lifestyle for most people.
 
 Ready to retire?
 
 There is no longer a compulsory retirement age, with the default age of 65 having been phased out. It is important to note that retirement age is not the same as state pension age, which can range between 61 and 68 depending on gender and date of birth.[5]
 
 The age of retirement is decided by the employee, because not everyone feels ready to retire at the same time. If you want, or need, to keep working, discuss this with your employer. Or, you may see this as an opportunity to work part time, change to flexible working hours, or find a new job.
 
 ? The law is evolving in this area, so follow the links in the 'Employment' section of www.gov.uk for current information.
 
 ? If you think you have experienced age discrimination, organisations such as Age UK[6] and Acas[7] can offer information, advice and help (see page 56 onwards).
 
 Still busy
 
 Being retired doesn't mean you aren't still busy. Being retired (or semi-retired) can be a busy life. Friends and family can have plans for your time, filling it with anything from childcare to DIY tasks. It is important to make time for your own interests. This can be a chance to try a new activity or learn new skills.
 
 Sense of purpose
 
 If your work or career is a major part of your life, consider how to deal with the changes to:
 
 * The social aspect of your life if your job also provided friendships
 
 * Your sense of self-worth and self-esteem if you felt valued at work
 
 * Your financial security
 
 If you haven't had many interests outside of work it can be hard to 'find something new to do' and it may take a few attempts before you find something that's right for you. Take your time and think about the skills you possess that can be put to good use and give you fulfilment - perhaps try helping out with a local community organisation or doing conservation work.
 
 With others
 
 Social interaction is important for maintaining your wellbeing.[8] If you are used to sharing life's ups and downs with others at work, keep up friendships once you retire. Others who are your age are great sounding boards for dealing with the challenges of retirement and can understand the transition into retirement. You should also look to develop new friendships with people of all ages. Friendships with both older and younger people help to keep you in touch with the world as it changes.
 
 See also '3. Ask for help' 
 
 Misconceptions
 
 Some people do develop mental health problems or conditions, such as depression, dementia or memory loss, as they get older, but it isn't an inevitable part of old age. However, if you think you are developing a mental health problem or condition, don't worry and just take action, as there are treatments available.
 
 * If you are worried about your memory, or dementia, speak to your GP or visit www.dementiacare.org.uk for more information.
 
 You might think that pursuing new learning and work is just for young people, but volunteering, career changes and returning to education are becoming more popular with people over 50.[9] Many organisations depend on the skills and experience that older people possess. Don't dismiss volunteering as for 'do-gooders': many people can tell you it's an essential part of getting work experience. Volunteering can even be good for your health.[10]
 
 2. Talk about problems and concerns
 
 Managing problems, difficulties and worries becomes easier if we talk about our concerns. It's a good way to rationalise our thoughts and make sense of a situation or of how we feel. It can make us feel supported and not alone.[11]
 
 Who to talk to
 
 Who you want to talk with depends on what's worrying you. You could try:
 
 * Friends and family
 
 * Someone with specialist knowledge - perhaps someone with financial planning experience if you are struggling to meet the bills
 
 * An impartial person - for instance, for concerns about care for your partner
 
 * A person who promises confidentiality, such as a counsellor
 
 There are suggestions about who to talk to in '3. Ask for help'
 
 Say what you feel
 
 Talking about problems and concerns doesn't mean you have to discuss your emotions, or lay yourself completely bare about how you're feeling. Some people may find this helpful, while others prefer to keep conversations on a practical level. Talking about how you feel, or your emotions, isn't a sign of weakness: it's about taking charge of your wellbeing.
 
 Listen and learn
 
 Having a chat is never a one-way street. Sharing your thoughts can help others find the courage to talk about their problems. If you don't want to talk about yourself, ask others how they feel.
 
 Hearing that others have similar worries and thoughts can make it easier to discuss something that's bothering you.
 
 Everyday event
 
 Being able to talk with others should be an everyday event. Don't put off having a chat, and avoid building it up to be a big event, like 'we must talk about the wills', as this can make it daunting for you and the other person. An ongoing conversation over days or weeks allows everyone time to think and give considered input.
 
 'Conversations don't have to be all about life's difficulties. Tell each other about the enjoyable events too!'
 
 3. Ask for help
 
 Who do we ask or where do we go when we need help or advice?
 
 Friends and family
 
 Support from friends and family is invaluable. However, they may lack the specialist knowledge you need despite their best intentions.
 
 Practical help
 
 Whether you need help fixing a leaky gutter or with managing limited finances, the following organisations can either help you directly or point you in the right direction.
 
 * Age UK offers online and phone support on hundreds of topics, from making a will and care in your own home, to keeping active and learning to use the Internet. Visit www.ageuk.co.uk for more information on Age UK's services.
 
 * The Citizens Advice service helps people resolve their legal, money and other problems by providing free, independent and confidential advice. Visit www.citizensadvice.org.uk for more information, help and advice.
 
 * Local councils offer services from adult education and parking permits for disabled people to housing grants and waste disposal, many of which are specifically for older residents.
 
 * www.gov.uk provides information on a range of social and legal issues, such as trading standards, dealing with doorstep sales, reporting antisocial behaviour and finding local health services, as well as providing help for understanding money, tax, benefits and pensions.
 
 Emotional help
 
 Admitting that times are emotionally tough isn't easy. Asking for help can be harder. Difficult feelings can stop you from getting on with life. Feeling down or anxious for prolonged periods doesn't just impact on you, but can also affect those around you; for instance, if your mood or reactions are unpredictable.
 
 * Samaritans provides confidential, non-judgmental emotional support 24 hours a day.
 
 * Cruse Bereavement Care promotes the wellbeing of anyone affected by bereavement and enables bereaved people to understand their grief and cope with their loss.
 
 * Your GP can help in practical ways, as well as offering a listening ear; for instance, they can recommend exercise therapy, counselling, help from a specialist, or support from another part of the health service.
 
 * Counselling offers the opportunity to talk about issues in confidence and to create a structured plan to make a positive change to your life.
 
 Online
 
 As well as advice from official sources, such as those given above, Internet forums, chatrooms and networking sites can allow you to share your own experiences with others facing the same issues.
 
 Age UK and some local councils offer training courses in using email and the Internet.
 
 'Your GP can help in practical ways, as well as offering a listening ear; for instance, they can recommend exercise therapy, counselling, help from a specialist, or support from another part of the health service.'
 
 4. Think ahead and have a plan
 
 Allowing an issue to become a constant worry can be bad for our mental wellbeing. Having a plan to deal with it puts us back in charge and can help improve how we feel.
 
 What needs planning?
 
 These are some things that can cause worry as you get older:[12]
 
 * Retirement
 
 * Staying active, having a healthy life, and mobility
 
 * The physical and mental health of ourselves and others
 
 * Pensions and financial considerations
 
 * Access to local facilities and transport
 
 * Remaining independent and having control over our own life
 
 * Caring for ourselves and others
 
 * Wills, end of life, and funerals
 
 It is also important to plan for pleasurable things, such as spending time with family, developing new hobbies, and enjoying your leisure time. If you don't have a plan for your time, you may find that others plan it for you.
 
 What a plan can do
 
 A plan can help you think through all the aspects of a problem or situation. By preparing a plan, you are likely to expose and deal with many of your worries in advance.[13]
 
 You may need to do some research, like finding out about the state pension, National Insurance top ups, pension credits, and buying an annuity.
 
 The government's website (www.gov.uk) is a good place to start when fact-finding.
 
 Your plan should have a clear aim, such as staying active. A regular review of your plan helps to make sure you are still on track.
 
 Include in your plan the sort of feelings you could experience and how you could deal with them. Discussing wills or care needs with loved ones may be emotional - how will you react?
 
 Use your plan
 
 How you use a plan is up to you - it's for your benefit. Consider whether you want to write it down or not. This may depend on whether you want to share it with others.
 
 By having a plan, you always have something to refer back to and to use when you face a problem.
 
 Be flexible
 
 Of course, not everything can be planned for, and plans need to change as situations alter; for example, a change to the benefit system may affect your financial planning. Review and amend your plans as you need to.
 
 5. Care for others
 
 As we get older, we may find ourselves looking after grandchildren, elderly parents, partners, friends, or neighbours. Caring for others can keep relationships strong and people close.
 
 Helping others makes us feel needed and valued, as well as boosting our self-esteem.[14] These things are good for our mental wellbeing.
 
 What type of care?
 
 Care could be looking after your grandchildren during school holidays, or the long-term and full-time care of your partner or elderly parents. Being a carer isn't always easy. Many find it demanding both physically and emotionally.
 
 Looking after a loved one whose mental and/or physical health is deteriorating can present extra challenges for carers. If this issue affects you, contact your GP, Age UK, or your local social services. There is help and support widely available.
 
 Who cares for us?
 
 Caring for others can be rewarding, such as seeing your grandchildren taking their first steps or sharing a laugh with a neighbour. However, there can be stresses and strains along the way.
 
 Try not to overburden yourself with care responsibilities. Hard though it seems, it is alright to say 'no'. Making time for yourself is good both for you and for the person you care for.
 
 If you feel under pressure to keep saying 'yes', then contact Carers UK, Counsel and Care, or Crossroads Care for advice or help with respite care to enable you to recharge your batteries.
 
 A local carers' support group may help to make you feel less isolated with your responsibilities. Talking with other carers helps to release frustrations, as they understand the pressures that caring can bring. There can also be opportunities to share resources, skills and knowledge so that everyone (other carers and the people you care for) benefits. The organisations mentioned above can help, and your GP or local council may know of local groups, services and facilities.
 
 Caring community
 
 If you are interested in helping care for others locally, then the organisations listed above would be glad to hear from you. Voluntary schemes offer a range of help to people in the community; for instance, WRVS provides meals on wheels.
 
 To offer your help, visit www.do-it.org.uk for more information.
 
 6. Keep in touch
 
 Friends
 
 Friends can keep you on track when life is difficult. They can offer a different view on a problem as well as practical help, or can be a sounding board for your thoughts.
 
 Friendship takes time, and sometimes effort. It is easy to lose touch with people, especially if their life seems too busy for you or if you are feeling down. Having friends is a positive way to maintain good emotional health,[15] even when doing so may sometimes seem like hard work.
 
 Don't lose touch with the people who are important to you - it's never too late to get back in touch with old friends.
 
 Small world
 
 You may have friends and family scattered around the country or world. Explore keeping in touch by phone, email, webcam, Skype, Facebook, or letter.
 
 The world's not what it used to be
 
 The world is constantly changing, and you are not alone if you feel out of step with it. Technology has had a big impact on the way we communicate. You may feel that the values and attitudes you have are no longer respected. But not everyone from the younger generation lives up to their media reputation.
 
 Keeping in touch with people from other generations can help to keep this in perspective and can make you realise that there are like-minded people of all ages.
 
 Consider volunteering with youth work, chatting more with friends' grandchildren, or helping out at a local school.
 
 Having friends of your own generation is important, too. They can better understand life from your perspective. Plus, it's good to reminisce sometimes about old TV favourites or the types of cars you used to own.
 
 Old and new
 
 If you're used to a close circle of friends at work, will you keep in touch when you retire? You may find that work friends were great when you shared common problems, but that the friendship changes when you no longer work together.
 
 Don't shy away from making new friends - perhaps through a new shared interest, such as walking, travelling or reading.
 
 Friendships do change with time. Sometimes it is difficult to give the time we want to every friendship. Friendships can go sour for many reasons. If a friendship starts to hurt you, mentally or physically, then don't be afraid to take a break from it, or end it.
 
 Is it good now?
 
 Keeping in touch with friends is also about considering what is good for them. Don't be offended if your children can't talk when you phone at 6.30pm as they sit down for a family meal or are starting to help with their own children's homework. Likewise, calling people when they are at work won't always get the best result; try meeting them for lunch instead. Similarly, if you don't want to be called after 9.00pm because it's time to get ready for bed, let your loved ones know!
 
 7. Be active and sleep well
 
 Staying active[16] and sleeping well[17] are proven ways to look after our wellbeing.
 
 Physical activity
 
 Regular physical activity and exercise can:[18]
 
 * Boost self-esteem, raise self-worth and improve confidence
 
 * Promote good sleep patterns
 
 * Provide a meaningful activity
 
 * Offer a chance to meet people
 
 * Be something that you really enjoy doing
 
 Being active doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym; t'ai chi, Pilates, gardening, dog walking, dancing, or being part of a walking group are all good ways to get some exercise. Being active doesn't have to cost much money. Many councils offer activities at lower rates for older people.
 
 The Mental Health Foundation booklet 'How to look after your mental health using exercise' suggests ways that you can get active and stay active.[19]
 
 Physical activity can be as effective as anti-depressant medication in treating mild to moderate depression,[20] which is why exercise therapy[21]is available on prescription in many areas. Information is available at www.nhs.uk, or your GP may be able to help.
 
 Sleep
 
 Getting a good night's sleep allows your body and mind to rest, repair and re-energise. Not sleeping well can cause a range of problems, including:[22]
 
 * Poor concentration
 
 * Low mood
 
 * Irritability
 
 * A weakened immune system
 
 In the longer term, trouble sleeping can lead to mental health problems such as anxiety, stress and depression.[23]
 
 Sleep patterns can change with age[24] and may be influenced by:
 
 * Caffeine or alcohol intake
 
 * Pain
 
 * Medication
 
 * The need to go to the toilet
 
 Good sleep doesn't just mean lots of sleep, as the amount of sleep that each person needs is different. The Mental Health Foundation's booklet 'Sleep Well'[25] suggests ways that you can improve your sleep. You can also talk to your GP about sleep problems, as they may be able to change your medication or suggest solutions to other health issues that may be keeping you awake.
 
 Mentally active
 
 Keeping your mind active is important, too. There are many ways of doing this, such as:[26]
 
 * Tackling puzzles, like crosswords, Sudoku or word searches
 
 * Playing games, like chess, bridge or bingo
 
 * Reading a book, magazine or newspaper
 
 * Going on a course or learning a new skill
 
 * Using your memory instead of writing a list
 
 * Using mental arithmetic instead of a calculator
 
 * Playing a musical instrument, if you can
 
 8. Eat and drink sensibly
 
 What we eat and drink affects how we feel.[27] Sometimes there's an immediate effect, for instance with alcohol. Other things we consume can have long-term impacts.
 
 Balanced and healthy
 
 The human body and mind needs a mix of nutrients to work properly.[28] Eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day is recommended, and is a vital part of a healthy diet.[29]
 
 Stay hydrated
 
 Stopping your body from dehydrating is important, whatever the weather.[30] You may want to consider limiting your intake of sugary drinks, caffeine, and alcohol as, in excess, they can have a negative effect on your wellbeing.
 
 Moderate drinking
 
 The odd alcoholic drink is unlikely to harm you if you drink them in moderation and if alcohol doesn't conflict with any medication you are taking. Stay within the recommended daily alcohol units.
 
 Popping to the pub or club for a drink can be a good social experience, but solitary habitual drinking is often a sign of a problem. Drinking alcohol is not a good way to manage difficult feelings.
 
 Visit www.drinkaware.co.uk for more information and advice.
 
 Social experience
 
 Sharing food or a drink is an enjoyable social event. Make it a reason to meet up with friends, even if it's just for a cuppa in the local café.
 
 Eating properly when coping with bereavement can be difficult, especially if you are not used to cooking for one or preparing meals at all. During this time, your appetite may be affected by your emotions. Try not to eat alone all the time. Take up offers from friends and family to eat with them. Find out if there are any lunchtime clubs that operate in your area, perhaps as part of a reading group or other interest groups.
 
 For more information on alcohol, see the Mental Health Foundation's guide to alcohol and mental health[31]
 
 9. Do things that you enjoy
 
 Doing things that we enjoy makes us feel good about ourselves and about life; plus, it can keep our mind and body active. Whatever we call them, interests, hobbies and pastimes can provide a chance to socialise, or to find time for ourselves.
 
 Work
 
 Some people enjoy their work so much that they don't want to retire. Explore the options with your employer. As there is no longer a default retirement age, there are a number of options available to explore.
 
 Something new
 
 If work has taken up most of your life, it may be time to look around for a new interest to immerse yourself in. Meaningful activity is vital for good emotional health, so try to start new activities before you retire. Don't be scared to try a few things before settling on the ones that you enjoy.
 
 'Sometimes when I'm sitting on the bus, I let my thoughts flow and it really helps me.'
 
 You may have skills to share with others. Look at local volunteering options, or join a specialist interest group. Time Bank is a skill-share scheme where you benefit from other people's skills in exchange for your own. Or you may want to learn new skills or develop an old one. Local councils and universities run a range of education and learning opportunities, often at lower rates for older people.
 
 Companionship
 
 Pets make wonderful companions and can bring social benefits, too.[32]Walking the dog gives you daily exercise, is a reason to go out, and is a way of meeting people. House rabbits love to play, and cats crave a warm lap to curl up on.
 
 Your local vet or the RSPCA can advise about the best type of pet for you.
 
 Your interests
 
 Always make time for your own hobbies and interests. If you are a busy carer, you must still find time for your own interests in order to look after your own wellbeing.
 
 10. Relax and have a break
 
 While being retired or semi-retired may appear to others to be a permanent holiday, the reality is different. There are still jobs that need doing, like cleaning, car repairs, financial paperwork, and shopping. Plus, we may have new responsibilities as a carer.
 
 Break from routine
 
 Creating a routine for your day or week can give life a structure or rhythm. However, a break from this refreshes the mental batteries.
 
 Plan free time in your weekly routines for things you enjoy, whether it's time in the park or in the art gallery.
 
 A break needn't be long: just time for what you enjoy and for letting your mind recharge. Look at how you spend your time. Can you find half an hour each day to pick up a book or sit with a crossword? What about every week? Is there time for an afternoon out?
 
 Taking a break can be:
 
 * A couple of hours away one afternoon
 
 * An evening at the theatre
 
 * A day trip
 
 * A midweek venture
 
 * A two-week cruise
 
 It's whatever relaxes you and helps you take a break.
 
 Cost
 
 Having a break need not cost a fortune. There are many bargains to be had - sometimes for booking well in advance, others for those who book last-minute. Some travel companies offer special rates for older people. Does your council offer free or discounted public transport for over 65s? Are there lower rates or free entrance to local attractions?
 
 Learn to relax
 
 You may find it hard to relax if you feel under pressure to be doing something else. This can be because you feel guilty about not caring for others, or because you aren't used to having time to spend on yourself.
 
 Right for you
 
 Relaxing doesn't have to be about sitting down or physically relaxing. It's about doing something you enjoy.
 
 Having a hectic life may mean you want time alone when you have a break. Or do you want the company of others to stimulate your mind and make you think of things other than the stresses of life? Having a break can be a chance to meet new people and explore interests. It can be as active or as restful as you want - from a pottery course or learning first aid, to a walking weekend or trying paragliding!

 We can all feel low or anxious from time to time. If you're going through difficult times or you're feeling sad, you should seek help and support early on.

 What is depression?
 
 Depression is more common than many people realise - it affects 1 in 5 people.
 
 Being depressed can show itself in different ways and each person's experience will be different. Symptoms include:
 
 * lack of interest and unable to enjoy things you normally enjoy
 
 * being reluctant to engage in usual activities or leave your house
 
 * feeling tired
 
 * sleeping too much or too little
 
 * loss of appetite or eating more than usual
 
 * losing or gaining weight over a relatively short time
 
 * losing confidence in yourself and feeling life is pointless
 
 * being self-critical and feeling guilty
 
 * having suicidal thoughts.
 
 Feeling down isn't a natural part of ageing, it's a sign that you're not feeling as well as you should be. Older people with depression usually experience more physical symptoms - such as tiredness, weight loss, and problems sleeping. These aren't trivial matters; they're crucial to your health.
 
 If you've experienced some of these symptoms on most days for 2-4 weeks, you should speak to a medical professional. Talking about your mental health can be daunting, but your GP will be used to having these conversations and won't judge you. They are there to help and will know what to do. 
 
 What is anxiety?
 
 Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear that everyone experiences from time to time. Symptoms of anxiety include:
 
 * feeling restless or 'on edge'
 
 * irritability
 
 * racing heartbeat
 
 * dry mouth
 
 * nausea
 
 * sweating.
 
 These symptoms are completely normal but can affect your daily life. If you find yourself worrying all or most of the time, and you're experiencing physical symptoms such as a fast heartbeat, shaking or sweating, make an appointment with the GP. You can talk to your doctor or nurse at any time, in complete confidence. They won't judge you - they're there to listen and help you get back on track.
 
 It's not uncommon to feel low and worried at the same time. Doctors are used to seeing people who feel depressed and anxious and know how to help.
 
 Don't brush how you feel under the carpet and hope it will sort itself out - symptoms are likely to get worse if you don't take action. Having depression or anxiety is like a physical health condition, and it can be successfully treated.
 
 What causes depression or anxiety?
 
 Depression and anxiety can happen for no obvious reason. But in many cases it can be triggered by certain life events, such as:
 
 * money or finance issues
 
 * bereavement - losing your partner or close friend.
 
 * relationship or family problems
 
 * retirement
 
 * disability or poor health
 
 * housing issues, such as moving homes
 
 * becoming a carer
 
 * the time of year.
 
 These situations might make anyone feel low and not everyone who experiences these goes on to develop depression. But thinking about any triggers can help you understand your feelings.
 
 Everyone feels down from time to time, but if you've not been feeling yourself for a while it's time to talk to someone - like your doctor, nurse or a trusted friend or family member. 
 
 How are depression and anxiety diagnosed?
 
 There are no specific tests but your GP may perform some blood tests for other health conditions that share similar symptoms with depression or anxiety.
 
 Your GP will need to get a good picture of the way you're feeling mentally and physically. They will ask you lots of questions about your symptoms and the changes you've noticed.
 
 It can be difficult to think about specific answers on-the-spot but the following suggestions might help you plan ahead for your appointment.
 
 * Make a list of all your symptoms, whether they are worse at certain times of the day or on particular occasions, how long you've had them and their effect on your day-to-day life and relationship with others.
 
 * Explain any circumstances that could be contributing to these symptoms and the way you feel.
 
 * Take a list of all medications you currently take, including any supplements or non-prescription medication.
 
 * Be as open and honest as you can; remember anything you say is confidential.
 
 How is depression and anxiety treated?
 
 If you broke your leg, you wouldn't just struggle on without help. You'd get in seen to. Mental health is as important as physical health and can be treated successfully. There are several treatments available - often a combination of treatments is needed.
 
 If your symptoms are mild, your GP may take a 'wait and see' approach. They may give you some advice on how to cope with symptoms then see if symptoms improve within a few weeks.
 
 Talking treatments
 
 There's something called 'talking therapies' now, which can really help people who are feeling low, anxious or out of sorts.
 
 Talking treatments allow you to talk to a trained professional who can help you manage your thoughts and feelings and the effect they have on your mood and behaviour.
 
 Examples of talking treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling. They may be one-on-one sessions or in a group environment.
 
 If you are considering talking treatments, be sure to mention any cultural, language or religious needs you have or any hearing or sight problems, so they can be addressed when arranging therapy for you. Talking treatments are effective and available for free on the NHS.
 
 Free talking therapies on the NHS
 
 Talking therapies are proven to work - and they can work particularly well for people who are older. You can refer yourself to see if your local service can help, or your doctor or nurse can do it for you if you prefer. Even if you've tried them before and weren't sure, you can give talking therapies another go. 
 
 Applied relaxation
 
 A trained practitioner can teach you muscle relaxation techniques to help you cope in situations where you feel anxious.
 
 Medications (anti-depressants)
 
 Your GP may prescribe medications to help treat the symptoms of depression. There are a range of different types of antidepressants available and your GP should explain which is best for you. Antidepressants are often combined with talking treatments.
 
 It can take up to two weeks for medications to start having an effect. You may need to continue taking anti-depressants for several months to ensure a long-term recovery.
 
 Be sure to continue with any prescribed medication or treatments as this is important for your long term health and wellbeing. If your symptoms seem to be returning, let friends and family know and make an appointment to see your GP so any problems can be resolved quickly.
 
 Is St John's Wort good for depression and anxiety?
 
 St John's Wort is a herbal remedy that's available without a prescription from health shops and pharmacies. It isn't recommended by doctors or the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
 
 St John's Wort can cause serious side effects and interact with prescription medications, including anti-depressants.
 
 How can I support my mental health?
 
 Having depression or anxiety isn't a sign of weakness and there's no need to feel embarrassed. Keep active in your community, consider joining a support group and do things that boost your mental wellbeing.
 
 Self-help groups
 
 Meeting other people who understand what you're going through can be helpful, especially if you're feeling isolated or lonely. You can find a local support group by asking your GP, or by contacting Mind, Anxiety UK, SANE or Rethink Mental Illness.
 
 Keep a regular social routine
 
 There are a range of services in the local community where you can meet new people and learn new skills. This will give you something to look forward to, and prevent you feeling isolated or alone. Your local Age UK can help you find an activity or group that will suit your interests.
 
 What do I do if I'm worried that a relative or friend has depression or anxiety?
 
 If you think a friend or relative is experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, try to talk to them about it.
 
 You may feel uncomfortable bringing up a sensitive topic, especially if the person you're concerned about doesn't often talk about their emotions. Explain why you are concerned but avoid diagnosing their problem or forcing solutions.
 
 They may be unwilling to talk about it, but let them know that you're willing to listen when they're ready.
 
 There are various ways you can help them, such as:
 
 * Offer your support, listen and reassure them that how they're feeling can be improved.
 
 * Stay in touch, call or visit regularly. The risk of depression increases when people feel alone and unsupported.
 
 * Encourage them to make an appointment with their GP or another health professional. Offer to go with them to appointments.
 
 * Encourage them to keep active and healthy. Plan occasional outings to get them out of the house.
 
 Supporting a relative or friend with depression can be both rewarding and stressful. There is information and support for carers where you can get help for the difficulties you experience. Contact Carers Direct, Carers UK and the Carers Trust for more information.

 Coping with the death of a loved one can be extremely hard. You may be dealing with lots of different emotions, finding it hard to process them and having difficulties moving on.
 
 ? How can I cope with my feelings after the death of my loved one?
 
 ? How do I manage if I'm feeling so tired and drained?
 
 ? How do I stay on top of the practical things I need to do?

 How can I cope with my feelings after the death of my loved one?
 
 Grief can make you feel many different things. It's important to remember that these feelings are not bad or wrong. They are a normal part of bereavement, and there are no quick answers to how you might be feeling.
 
 Coping with fear
 
 Feeling fearful and anxious is natural - your familiar world has been turned upside down. You may feel that you have little control over your life, your thoughts and emotions. This is likely to make you feel vulnerable and afraid. But as you get used to coping, in time, you will begin to feel more capable of dealing with your changed circumstances.
 
 Something that might help: If you are feeling overwhelmed by fearful thoughts or anxiety, it could help to talk to someone about how you are feeling. It can take a lot of courage to admit you're struggling, but don't keep it to yourself. Read our section below on where to go for support and help.
 
 Coping with emptiness and depression
 
 Feelings of depression and emptiness can hit you when the reality of the death begins to sink in. Although it may feel almost unbearable at the time, this seems to be a period when some inner healing takes place. Afterwards, people say they feel lighter, more in control of their lives and better able to look forward.
 
 Sadness is a natural response to bereavement, but some people may become depressed. You don't have to try to cope on your own and help is available.
 
 Something that might help: You can talk to your doctor at any time, in complete confidence. They won't judge you - they're there to listen and help you get back on track. Remember that you can phone Samaritans, day or night, on 08457 90 90 90
 
 Coping with anger
 
 You may feel anger at the injustice of your loss, or at the lack of understanding in others. You might be angry at yourself and at the person who died, who has left you feeling abandoned, frightened and alone. These feelings are normal.
 
 Something that might help: Don't bottle up your feelings - try to think about the reasons for your anger. Talking about your feelings with someone who isn't emotionally involved in your loss can help. It's not always easy to open up about our feelings, but there's a lot of truth in that old saying 'a problem shared is a problem halved.'
 
 Coping with guilt
 
 Some people experience feelings of guilt when someone dies. You may find yourself wondering if you could have done more to help, or feeling guilty about something you said or didn't say to them when they were alive.
 
 Something that might help: Guilt is a natural emotion after bereavement, but it's important not to dwell on things in the past that you can't change. Try not to be too hard on yourself or anyone else.
 
 Coping with loneliness
 
 You may feel as though the person who died has left a big hole in your life, and this can leave you feeling lonely, especially if you spent a lot of your time with them.
 
 Something that might help: Make the most of opportunities to spend time with other people and keep in touch with friends and family.
 
 Find someone to talk to
 
 If you've not been feeling yourself since the bereavement, there's support available. Cruse Bereavement Care can offer practical advice or just someone to chat to about how you're feeling.
 
 Contact Cruse
 
 How do I manage if I'm feeling so tired and drained?
 
 You may find that you experience physical changes after bereavement. These can include:
 
 * difficulty getting to sleep
 
 * vivid dreams
 
 * long periods of wakefulness
 
 * loss of appetite
 
 * feeling tense and short of breath, or edgy and restless
 
 * feeling slow and lethargic.
 
 You're likely to feel exhausted, especially if you were caring for the person who died or if you went through an anxious time before their death. Strong emotions and dealing with all the practical things that need to be done after a death can also leave you tired and drained.
 
 Something that might help: Take extra care of yourself - try to eat well and get some rest even if you can't sleep. Take gentle exercise if you can. Be kind to yourself - don't try to do too much while you're grieving.
 
 How do I stay on top of the practical things I need to do?
 
 In addition to the strong emotions that you may feel after a bereavement, you may also be worrying about practical issues, such as how to manage on a smaller income and handle household tasks.
 
 You might find these things helpful:
 
 * Find out if you can get any bereavement benefits to give you some extra money.
 
 * Use our benefits calculator to see if you are eligible to claim anything which could boost your income.
 
 * If you're worried about keeping up with the housework, talk to your local Age UK to see if they offer any services or know where you could get some help (you may have to pay for this).
 
 Where can I find more help and support?
 
 Therapies based on talking to a trained professional are proven to help get us back on track. Chat with your doctor or nurse and ask them how talking to someone might help.
 
 Help and support from others, especially those who have gone through a similar loss, may help you to cope with your bereavement. There are peer support services in many areas - ask at your place of worship, if you have one, or your local Age UK, doctor's surgery or local library, or search online for local services.
 
 Cruse Bereavement Care can offer practical advice, signposting to services or just someone to chat to about how you're feeling. They are also offering some specific advice around coping with grief during the coronavirus pandemic.

 Feeling down isn't a natural part of ageing. Low mood, depression and anxiety don't just become a feature of life as you get older- they're signs that you're not feeling as well as you could be.

 If you're feeling out of sorts and have any of these symptoms for two weeks or more, you may be experiencing anxiety or?depression:
 
 * loss of self-confidence and feeling down
 
 * feeling anxious
 
 * not being able to enjoy the things you usually enjoy
 
 * unexplained aches and pains
 
 * avoiding people, even those close to you.
 
 If you have any of these symptoms frequently, speak to your doctor and explain how you're feeling. Together you can agree on what next steps may be best for you. 
 
 Because of coronavirus, you might be worried about bothering your GP or going into the surgery - but how you're feeling mentally and emotionally is still a priority. Support is available and can be given over the phone too. 
 
 Even though it can be difficult to admit you're feeling low, a chat with your doctor or nurse is an important place to start. If you're feeling nervous about talking to your doctor, it's fine to ask someone to go with you to your appointment. It might not seem like it right now, but talking really does help.

 What can affect my mental wellbeing?
 
 There are plenty of reasons why you might be feeling like you do. But there also may be no clear reason at all - and that's fine too. 
 
 But thinking about some of the most common things that can affect how we all feel might help you understand the feelings you're experiencing and think about the steps you can take. Most people experience these things throughout their lives, though it can sometimes feel like they happen more often as we get older. But it's important to remember, it's not just your age. 
 
 Coronavirus pandemic
 
 Over the last few months, we've all been worried about their physical health and that of those they care about most. But staying at home, feeling lonely or isolated, the anxiety of either catching or spreading the virus and the worry of looking after yourself and those you care about can have an impact on how we feel mentally too. And that's perfectly natural - in fact 1 in 3 older people are feeling more anxious than they were before the pandemic. There are things you can do to help look after yourself mentally and there's support available to you. If you're finding it hard, it's important to talk to your GP. You don't need to cope alone.

 Retirement
 
 Many of us look forward to retirement. But often we can be so busy thinking about what we're retiring from that we don't take time to think about what we're retiring to. For many people the lack of routine and sense of purpose can impact their mental health.
 
 Bereavement
 
 Grieving is different for everyone and, for many, can last a long time. This process can be a rollercoaster of emotions and you're likely to have good days and bad days. It's normal to experience a variety of different feelings such as sadness, anger, frustration or even relief. If you're struggling to cope with the bad days, then it may be time to seek help and support.
 
 Being a carer
 
 Looking after your loved one is rewarding, but it can also be exhausting and even frustrating at times. It can feel like it takes over our lives and can affect how we feel mentally. It can be hard to ask for support as a carer, as you might feel guilty because you think you should only be focused on the person you're caring for - but you shouldn't neglect your own needs. It's OK to reach out and admit it's all getting a bit much. 
 
 Money worries
 
 Worrying about money can lead to sleepless nights and make us anxious. If you're having money worries or are living on a low income, why not use our benefits calculator to see if you're eligible for any benefits? If you're worried about debt, you're not alone and there is help available. It's never too early to seek help for money worries. Our page on debt advice is a good place to start. 
 
 Disability or poor physical health
 
 As we get older, poor health can affect our confidence, make us less independent and make us feel more anxious. It can become harder to get out and do the things we once enjoyed, which can be very frustrating and get us down. Side effects of certain medications can also have an impact on our feelings. Make sure you don't stop taking any medication before speaking to your doctor as it can be dangerous to stop suddenly.
 
 Relationship and family problems
 
 Worrying about those we care about most can really affect how we feel. They may be experiencing one of these issues themselves, or you might be worrying about things that could happen in the future. If possible, try to talk about any problems before they have a chance to escalate. If you feel like you can't talk or relate to family and friends, consider speaking to your doctor instead.
 
 Drinking alcohol
 
 Drinking too much could leave you feeling out of sorts. It can often lead to feelings of low mood and anxiety. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy a glass of wine or a dram of whisky every now and then - just try to do it in moderation. Find out more advice about alcohol here. 
 
 The time of year
 
 It's not uncommon for our mood to change with the seasons. Many of us feel better in the summer and feel low in the colder, darker winter months. You may commonly hear this referred to as the 'winter blues'. But for some people, the different seasons can have a significant impact on their mental wellbeing and leave them feeling tired, withdrawn and depressed or anxious. If the time of year has a significant impact on your mood, read our page on Seasonal Affective Disorder.

45,0,"Mental health and physical health are interlinked
 
 When we're talking about our health or thinking about visiting the doctor we can easily overlook our mental health and just focus on the physical.
 
 Your wellbeing
 
 Over the past months we've been spending a lot more time apart from our family and friends and have had to stay at home more than we normally would. This has meant big changes to our normal routines, so it's important we look after our mental and physical health.
 
 ? Things to think about
 
 We all have mental health - though many of us see our physical health as more important. But both are important and usually affect each other.
 
 One in three older people are feeling more anxious now than before the start of the pandemic. So, if you're feeling out of sorts, you're not alone.
 
 Sometimes, when you don't feel quite right in yourself it can be easier to assume it must be something physical. But, actually, there are plenty of symptoms that might surprise you as signs that there could be something else going on.
 
 Do an of these sound familiar?
 
 * Feeling sick or dizzy.
 
 * Losing your appetite.
 
 * Feeling tired all the time.
 
 * Talking slower than usual.
 
 * Feeling like your heart is racing.
 
 * Heavy limbs.
 
 * Feeling weak.
 
 * Having a lump in your throat.
 
 A lot of these can be mental health symptoms that are more common in older adults and are often overlooked. These aren't trivial matters, and you shouldn't ignore or downplay them; they're crucial to your health and wellbeing.
 
 Physical health conditions can have an impact on your mental health
 
 You may have lived with a physical health condition for some time, your health may be getting worse or you may have recently received a diagnosis. This can also affect your mental health and make you feel anxious, stressed and out of sorts.
 
 If you're worried your mental health is having an effect on your physical health or vice versa then talk to someone about it. Speak to your GP about how you're feeling. The NHS is there for you if you need them. Whatever you're dealing with, your GP wants to help.
 
 If you broke your leg, you wouldn't just struggle on without help and wait for it to fix itself. It would only get worse. And while it might feel daunting, the doctor is there to help you when you're not feeling as well as you could mentally as well as physically. Talking about how you're feeling is an important first step to feeling better.
 
 What else can affect my mental health?
 
 Struggling with your mental health isn't just an inevitable side effect of getting older. But as you age, things happen that can have a negative impact on your moods and self-esteem.
 
 * Feeling down isn't just a natural part of ageing. Find out more about what can affect your mood
 
 How can I help improve both my physical and mental health?
 
 There are some things you can do that can help you feel better both physically and mentally. 
 
 Sleep
 
 Sleep patterns change as we get older and lack of sleep can directly affect the way we feel. If you're having difficulty sleeping, try cutting back on daytime naps and reduce the amount of caffeine you drink. Try to make time to relax and unwind each evening, perhaps by reading a book or listening to the radio. Find out more here about getting a good night's sleep. 
 
 Eat well and drink sensibly
 
 What we eat and drink affects how we feel. Try not to fill up on the wrong things, but also don't ignore any signs you may not be eating enough, such as losing weight unexpectedly. We have more advice on healthy eating here.
 
 Exercise
 
 As well as keeping you healthy, exercise is a great way to improve your mood as it increases the production of endorphins - brain chemicals that make you feel happy. It can also be a good way to clear your mind and relax. It's never too late to get active. Simply getting outside for a few minutes every day can improve your mood. Perhaps you could think about joining a walking group or local activity class? Have a look at our tips on being active. 
 
 Review your medications
 
 Taking medications becomes more common as we get older, but can contribute to us feeling out of sorts, especially if taking several different ones. If you're worried this might be the case, ask your doctor for a review of your medications. We have more information about medicines here.

 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs particular seasons. It's more common in winter, as we adjust to the change in seasons and feel lower in mood and energy.

 ? What can I do to help myself?
 
 What are the symptoms of SAD?
 
 Typical symptoms of seasonal affective disorder include:
 
 * low mood
 
 * lacking energy
 
 * sleeping for longer and struggling to get up in the morning
 
 * overeating
 
 * not enjoying things you usually do
 
 * difficulty with concentration and memory.
 
 The severity of symptoms vary from one person to another. Some people might just find it harder to get out of bed on dark, chilly mornings whilst others find that their symptoms have a big impact on their daily life.
 
 Read more about symptoms on the NHS website
 
 What causes SAD?
 
 It's not known exactly what causes SAD, but it's thought to be linked to shorter days and less exposure to sunlight in the winter months.
 
 It's not unusual for older people to notice symptoms for the first time if they start to spend more time indoors due to health or mobility problems.
 
 How is SAD treated?
 
 If you're stuggling to cope with symptoms of SAD, you should visit your doctor. They may ask you questions about your mood, lifestyle, eating and sleeping habits, and the seasonal pattern of your symptoms.
 
 Treatment available includes cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), where you talk to a trained therapist to help change the way you think and feel about situations. You could try light therapy, which involves sitting in front of a special lamp that mimics sunlight. Your doctor can also prescribe antidepressants, which can help lift your mood.
 
 Speak to your GP about the risks and benefits of different treatments.
 
 Read more about treatment for SAD on the NHS website
 
 What can I do to help myself?
 
 As the nights draw in and the mornings get darker, it can make even those of us with the sunniest dispositions feel a little glum. But there are lots of simple things you can do which might help boost your mood.
 
 Get natural sunlight
 
 Getting outside in the natural sunlight as much as possible can help boost your mood. Even a short daily walk can help.
 
 If you find it hard to get out, try and make your home as bright as possible by opening the curtains and sitting near the window.
 
 Stay active
 
 Regular activity, especially outdoors on a bright day, can help with symptoms of low mood and depression.
 
 Connect with others
 
 Winter can make us feel more isolated, but there are lots of ways to keep in touch. From email and text message to a good old-fashioned post, try to find ways to reach out to friends and family.
 
 Age UK's Call in Time service offers anyone over 60 the opportunity to receive a weekly phone call from a like-minded volunteer. It's a great way to make a new friend and enjoy regular conversation.
 
 Have things to look forward to
 
 There's still lots to look forward to at this time of year. Christmas, Hanukah, Diwali... this time of year is full of celebrations, bringing colour, light and laughter to darker days.
 
 If finding things to enjoy about winter proves too much, keep in mind that spring will come - and with it warmer weather, the first spring blooms, and green leaves on the trees.
 
 Get cosy
 
 There's nothing like a hearty stew or steaming bowl of soup to make you feel cosier on a dreary day. And it's really important to eat well through the winter months. Putting together a hot meal doesn't have to be hard - get some inspiration from our recipes.
 
 If winter means you tend to stay indoors more, keeping busy with hobbies can help keep your mind active. Books can be a wonderful way of transporting yourself to another place and lifting your spirits. There are even services that deliver books and audio books to your door. See if the Royal Voluntary Service runs one where you live.
 
 Speak to your doctor
 
 There's no need to feel embarrassed about struggling emotionally. If you're feeling low or out of sorts, don't keep it to yourself.

47,0,"Brain health and mental wellbeing
 
 Mental wellbeing - feeling good, functioning well and coping adequately with life circumstances and challenges - is related to our brain health as we age. The Global Council on Brain Health (GCBH) explores the evidence, as part of our Staying Sharp series.
 
 Our advice
 
 ? Move. Seek out activities and exercise opportunities in nature.
 
 ? Discover. Make time in your day to laugh, learn, and be grateful.
 
 ? Relax. Find moments to disconnect, breathe deeply, and declutter your life. Get 7-8 hours of sleep.
 
 ? Nourish. Eat healthy foods and cut back on alcohol.
 
 ? Connect. Take the time to develop and strengthen relationships with family and friends. Reinforce your feelings of purpose in life by volunteering.

 * Find opportunities to exercise, particularly outdoors
 
 * Become a regular volunteer in the community
 
 * Learn something new
 
 * Understanding the connection between brain health and mental wellbeing
 
 Are mental wellbeing and brain health linked?
 
 The science behind how mental well-being is connected with brain health is not well-developed. However, a number of studies of older people have linked greater mental well-being to better cognitive health, and even reduced risks of dementia later in life. On the other hand, poor mental well-being - including pessimism and not feeling useful - may interfere with people's abilities to think and reason, as well as how they interact with others and how they manage their emotions. Here are some practical things you can do to support your mental wellbeing. 
 
 Look for activities you enjoy
 
 Regularly doing something that makes you feel good, like hobbies or exercise, is important for your mental wellbeing. It's important to find activities that appeal to you.
 
 Ideas for activities you might enjoy
 
 Seek out meaningful connections with others in your community
 
 Joining in community activities or volunteering can boost feelings of having a purpose in life. A 2018 survey in the USA found that the more often adults age 50 and over socialised, the higher their mental well-being scores. We also know from research in UK that good social connections are good for your thinking skills.
 
 Learn more about how social connections could help your thinking skills
 
 Aim to get enough high-quality sleep
 
 Get seven to eight hours sleep a night. Going to bed and getting up around the same time every day helps you to have a better night's sleep. Stay away from all digital screens before bedtime and avoid watching TV in bed. Studies have found that the LED light emitted by digital screens may prevent the brain from releasing the sleep hormone melatonin.
 
 Why sleep is important for your thinking skills.
 
 Eat healthy foods
 
 Experiment with different fruits, vegetables, and eat a healthy diet. The 2018 USA survey found that men and women age 50 and over who reported eating more nutritious and well-balanced meals also had higher mental well-being scores than those who said they rarely ate nutritious meals. We also know that a healthy diet can help your overall brain health and thinking skills in later life.
 
 More about how eating healthily can help protect your thinking skills
 
 Information from the NHS on healthy eating
 
 Find opportunities to exercise, particularly outdoors
 
 Explore green spaces in your neighbourhood and community, including local and national parks. Many local Age UKs arrange or know of local walking groups for people of different abilities. Also, try gardening. Digging in the dirt can be a great way to relieve stress, get exercise, and promote mental well-being.
 
 Find out how physical activity helps your brain and thinking skills.
 
 Become a regular volunteer in the community
 
 Those who volunteer tend to have less anxiety, depression, loneliness, and social isolation, as well as a sense of purpose in life. It's also a good way to develop meaningful connections in your local community. The 2018 USA survey found that adults age 50 or older who volunteer at least once a year have higher mental well-being scores than those who don't.
 
 Learn something new
 
 Find an interesting topic and learn as much as you can about it at your local library. Take a class at a local centre or the University of the Third Age (U3A). Or try out one of the many free or inexpensive online courses. Rekindle hobbies that brought you joy as a youngster, or consider trying a new hobby. Your local Age UK may also run classes or activities. Get in touch with them using the search box below.

48,0,"Looking after your mental health
 
 As we get older, changes in our lives, such as bereavement, illness or retirement, can affect our mental health. But getting older doesn't mean your mental health will always get worse. There are steps you can take to keep yourself feeling well and find help if you need it.
 
 What is mental health?
 
 Mental health describes your emotional wellbeing - how you think and feel, and how you deal with everyday stresses. It's just as important as your physical health. And like your physical health, it can get better or worse as your situation changes.
 
 You may not experience poor mental health as you get older. But if you do, you're not alone. Mental health problems are very common, although different types affect different numbers of people. Depression is the most common, affecting around one in five older people. Anxiety affects around one in 10 older people.
 
 What can affect your mental health
 
 As you get older, painful events or changes in your situation may affect your mental health and make you more vulnerable to problems, such as depression or anxiety. For example:
 
 ? ill health
 
 ? taking certain medications
 
 ? relationship breakdown
 
 ? bereavement and loss
 
 ? loneliness
 
 ? becoming a carer
 
 ? loss of independence
 
 ? finding it more difficult to do the things you used to do
 
 ? feeling more vulnerable as you get older - at risk of scams, for example
 
 ? loss of daily routine and social contact after retirement
 
 ? money worries
 
 ? moving house, including moving to a new area or moving into a care home.
 
 Sometimes, there might not be an obvious reason for how you're feeling.
 
 The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may be worrying too, especially if you can't see friends or family as usual. If you're feeling isolated or struggling with your mental health during the pandemic, read our page Staying connected and well when you're staying at home.
 
 Where to get support
 
 If your negative feelings don't go away or you're having trouble coping with them, you may benefit from some help and support. You could:
 
 * talk to your GP
 
 * tell someone you trust
 
 * call an emotional support helpline like Samaritans or The Silver Line
 
 * call a specialist mental health helpline like Rethink or Mind
 
 You could also use the self-help tools from the NHS. Try their mood self-assessment tool or visit Every Mind Matters.
 
 If you feel you can't go on
 
 If you start to think that life isn't worth living or that you want to harm yourself, seek help immediately. Contact your GP or NHS 111, or try calling Samaritans for 24-hour confidential support.
 
 Help to look after yourself
 
 If you're finding it harder to look after yourself, make sure you're getting enough support. Ask your local council for a care needs assessment, which will work out what your care needs are. If you need help expressing your views or to get support, you may benefit from an independent advocate. In some situations, you may have a legal right to an advocate.
 
 If you're worried about money
 
 If money worries are troubling you, make sure you're claiming all the benefits you're entitled to. Call our Helpline to arrange a benefits check or try our benefits calculator. You could also visit the Mental Health and Money Advice Service for advice and help.
 
 Help with specific problems
 
 If you're worried about a specific problem or you've been through a difficult situation, there may be a specialist organisation that can help. For example:
 
 * Cruse Bereavement Care - or see our guide Coping with bereavement
 
 * Relate for relationship advice
 
 * support for alcohol or drug dependency, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous - see our guide Coping with alcohol or drug misuse for details of more organisations.
 
 How to look after your mental health
 
 As well as getting support if you need it, there are things you can do to improve your mental health and help yourself stay well.
 
 Stay connected
 
 Loneliness and isolation can affect your mental health, so try to keep in touch with people. Find ways to increase your social connections, for example, doing a course or taking up a new hobby. Do things you enjoy to help take your mind off your worries.
 
 If you're looking for more social contact, you could consider signing up for regular calls from an Independent Age befriender. Look at our Get Support section or call our Helpline for details.
 
 Keep active
 
 Staying active can really help your mental health. It can give you more energy, boost your mood and help you to eat and sleep properly. Try to find an activity that works for you, for example:
 
 * gardening or housework
 
 * walking or cycling
 
 * tai chi
 
 * yoga
 
 * dancing.
 
 Before starting a new exercise routine, it's best to talk to your GP, especially if you're not used to regular exercise.
 
 If you have health or mobility issues, it's important to stay as active as you can. Exercises can be adapted, so talk to your GP about what types of activities you could try.
 
 Eat a healthy balanced diet
 
 Eating well can have a positive effect on how you feel. Aim for less high-sugar foods and drinks, and avoid drinking too much alcohol. Try to eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated and get at least five portions of fruit or veg a day. Visit NHS Eat Well or talk to your GP for more information.
 
 Help someone else
 
 Helping others can boost your mental health and your social connections. You could try volunteering, which is a great way to meet new people and help a cause you care about. Find something that suits your skills and interests. Try looking at:
 
 * charities - for example, Independent Age looks for volunteers to make regular friendship calls, see our Get involved section
 
 * do-it.org for volunteer opportunities in your area.
 
 Some volunteering opportunities may be limited during the coronavirus pandemic to reduce face-to-face meetings. But you may be available to volunteer online or over the phone.
 
 Go outside
 
 If you can, spending time in nature for just a couple of hours a week can really help your health and wellbeing. You could try an ecotherapy programme, which involves doing outdoor activities like gardening, conservation or arts and crafts. Contact your local Mind or ask your GP if there is one nearby that they can refer you to.
 
 Get enough sleep
 
 If you're having problems with sleeping, try changing your routine. Our webpage Getting a good night's sleep has advice on how to develop healthier sleeping habits and where to get help if you need it. 
 
 You could also learn relaxation techniques and breathing exercises to help you to feel calmer. You can find breathing exercises for stress on the NHS website.
 
 Next steps
 
 Talk to your GP or someone you trust about how you're feeling.
 
 Read our healthy living section for more ways to look after your physical health.
 
 Increase your social connections - try signing up for regular calls or volunteer with Independent Age.

49,1,"Depression
 
 Everyone gets low moods from time to time, but if it these feelings don't go away, it could be a sign of depression. Knowing what to look out for and where you can go for help are the first steps toward feeling better.
 
 What is depression?
 
 Depression is a common mental health problem that affects around one in five older people. It might include a low mood, feeling hopeless or losing enjoyment for things. However, depression also has many other symptoms you might not expect.
 
 How you might feel
 
 It can be hard to tell if you have depression because how it feels and what it looks like can vary from person to person. You might experience a range of thoughts and feelings. For example, you might:
 
 ? stop enjoying the things that you used to enjoy
 
 ? find it hard to concentrate
 
 ? feel helpless or hopeless
 
 ? become irritable around other people, or avoid them
 
 ? feel sad or have a low mood that doesn't lift
 
 ? have problems with your memory.
 
 Older people with depression can experience more physical symptoms. This might mean you:
 
 * start sleeping much more or less than usual
 
 * feel tired or more restless than normal
 
 * eat a lot more or less than usual
 
 * feel faint or dizzy.
 
 Visit the NHS website for more information about the symptoms of depression.
 
 If you think your friend or relative might have depression, our page If you're worried about someone's mental health has more advice on what you can do to help.
 
 What might cause depression
 
 It's easy to blame yourself if you're feeling low but remember that depression is not your fault. Any difficult setback or life change can affect our mental health, and make us more vulnerable to becoming depressed. Your feelings of depression may be set off by bereavement or loss, feeling lonely or isolated, a period of ill health, or even by certain medications. Sometimes, you may find there's no clear reason for feeling depressed.
 
 Depression and dementia
 
 Depression shares some symptoms with dementia, such as memory problems or difficulty concentrating. You may worry that you have dementia when you're actually experiencing depression. It may also make it harder to diagnose depression if you already have dementia. If you're worried about either condition, speak to your GP or visit the Alzheimer's Society for more information on depression and dementia.
 
 Getting help for depression
 
 Often, periods of low mood won't last long. But there are times when you might want to get some extra support. Depression isn't something you have to go through alone and it's worth considering support if:
 
 * you have negative feelings that are getting worse or last more than two weeks
 
 * symptoms are interfering with your daily life
 
 * your family and friends are worried
 
 * you've had thoughts of self-harm
 
 * you've thought that life isn't worth living
 
 * a practical problem that might have caused your depression has been solved, but you still feel down.
 
 If you feel you can't go on
 
 If you start feeling suicidal or thinking that you want to harm yourself, get help immediately. Contact your GP or NHS 111, or call Samaritans for 24-hour confidential support.
 
 Where to get help
 
 Talking about how you feel might be nerve-wracking, but getting the right support is a positive step towards feeling better. You could:
 
 * talk to your doctor
 
 * tell someone you trust, for example, a friend or relative
 
 * call an emotional support helpline, such as The Silver Line or Samaritans
 
 * call a mental health helpline, such as Rethink or Mind.
 
 Talking to your doctor
 
 If you're struggling to cope, speak to your GP. They will be able to assess your situation and talk about treatment options with you. They might suggest:
 
 * talking therapies, such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy
 
 * medication, including antidepressants
 
 * self-help resources and activities, such as support groups and books
 
 * a combination of these things.
 
 Write down everything you want to say to the GP before the appointment and check it off during the appointment to make sure you've covered everything. Our medical appointment planner can help you start. If you're nervous, you could ask a friend or relative to be with you for support.
 
 Treatments for depression
 
 There are lots of treatments available to help with depression. They can be very effective, even if you've been feeling low for a long time.
 
 Talking therapies
 
 Talking therapies are effective treatments for depression. They usually involve working with a trained therapist who can help you find ways to manage the difficulties you're having. There are lots of different types, including:
 
 * counselling
 
 * cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
 
 * guided self-help
 
 * interpersonal therapy.
 
 NHS psychological therapies (IAPT) services are open to all adults and offered one-to-one, in a group, over the phone or online. Your GP can refer you or you can refer yourself.
 
 Read the NHS website for more about talking therapies.
 
 Private therapy
 
 You might consider private therapy if:
 
 * waiting times for NHS therapy are very long
 
 * you've finished a short course of NHS therapy but want more support
 
 * you want more choice.
 
 The cost of private therapy can vary a lot, so it's worth looking around if you're thinking about this option.
 
 You can ask your GP or search the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) online directory to find a therapist. Make sure your therapist is accredited by a professional body, such as the BACP.
 
 Self-help groups and activities
 
 Your GP may suggest self-help resources or activities that you can do in your own time to help with managing depression. They might suggest:
 
 * books or audio guides
 
 * online resources, such as Every Mind Matters
 
 * guided self-help.
 
 You can also join a self-help group, which are run by a number of organisations, including Mind and Carers UK. Ask your GP or find support groups in your area on the NHS website. They may be running online rather than face-to-face during the coronavirus pandemic.
 
 Medication
 
 Your GP might offer you medication, such as anti-depressants, to help treat depression. You should be told about how long you may need to take them for and possible side effects. It's important to check that any new medication will work well with anything you're already taking.
 
 Make sure you follow your GP's advice for any medication you've been prescribed. If you want to come off them or take a lower dose, talk to your GP first, even if you're feeling better. Some anti-depressants can cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them too quickly.
 
 Ways to help yourself
 
 There are lots of ways you can help yourself, whether or not you're getting other treatment for depression. For general ways to look after your mental health, see our page Looking after your mental health.
 
 You could also try to:
 
 * stay in touch with others - even though you may feel like you want to avoid others, feeling lonely can add to depression. It might feel like an effort to at first, but keeping in touch with other people can help you feel more positive and put things in perspective
 
 * look after your physical health - how you feel physically can affect your mental health, so make sure you're getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruit and veg
 
 * keep active - moving your body regularly can help boost your mood but you might not feel like exercising if you're depressed. Remember, it's okay to start small - a short walk in the park or simple chair exercises, for example - and gradually do more as you start feeling better
 
 * do something you enjoy - you might not be in the mood at first, but doing things you enjoy, such as watching your favourite film or pursuing a hobby, can help lift your spirits
 
 * take things slowly - it can be hard to make decisions when you're feeling depressed. So, if you can, try to avoid making big changes, such as moving house, until you're feeling more like yourself.
 
 Finding the right combination of treatments and starting to feel better might take time. So try to be kind with yourself on both the good and bad days.
 
 Next steps
 
 Book an appointment with your GP, or consider referring yourself for NHS psychological therapies.

54,0,"How to cope when you're feeling lonely
 
 Loneliness can affect us all, whether we live alone or are surrounded by others. People feel lonely for all sorts of reasons and they find different ways to overcome it. Here are a few things that may help to reduce feelings of loneliness and some places to look for more support.
 
 Why you might be feeling lonely
 
 Loneliness is the feeling of sadness that can come from not having the social contact you would like. It may be the result of social isolation. But you could be surrounded by people and still feel lonely. It may be triggered by an event or change in circumstances. Or you may have felt lonely for some time.
 
 Some common experiences of older age could make you more likely to feel lonely, such as:
 
 ? retirement
 
 ? health problems that make it harder to get out and see others
 
 ? hearing or sight loss
 
 ? caring responsibilities
 
 ? the loss of someone close.
 
 You may also feel lonely if:
 
 * you're living on a low income and can't afford to socialise as much as you'd like
 
 * your adult children have moved away
 
 * you've lost touch with friends or family
 
 * you're shy or suffer from social anxiety
 
 * you live alone.
 
 These are just some examples. There may be no particular reason why you feel lonely and you don't need to look for one.
 
 Loneliness and depression
 
 Loneliness and depression are distinct experiences, but they are linked. One can lead to the other. If you're feeling low, visit our mental health hub. Find out more about depression and where you can get help, as well as ways you can keep yourself mentally well.
 
 How to deal with feelings of loneliness
 
 It can help to be aware of when you're feeling lonely, so you can try to change things. For example, you could try keeping a simple journal for a week. This may help you to see if there are particular times or situations that bring on feelings of loneliness.
 
 Look for opportunities to feel more connected. You could try setting yourself a weekly target, such as phoning an old friend or speaking to your neighbour. Our guide If you're feeling lonely has more suggestions.
 
 If there are practical barriers that are stopping you from getting out, such as caring for someone or lack of money or transport, you may be able to get support. Call our Helpline for advice.
 
 Thinking about yourself
 
 If you've been feeling lonely for a while, it might feel daunting to go out and meet new people. You might worry that others won't understand you or want to spend time with you. If your confidence is low, addressing how you're feeling and reaching out to others can help.
 
 Try to be kind to yourself and challenge negative thoughts. You could try using self-help resources, such as:
 
 * the Overcoming series of books recommended by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Titles include Overcoming Anxiety and Overcoming Low Self-Esteem
 
 * resource packs from the Red Cross
 
 * online tools on Every Mind Matters.
 
 Self-help isn't right for everyone, so speak to your GP if you think you need some support. They might refer you for a short course of counselling through the NHS. You can also refer yourself.
 
 Talking about it
 
 If you're going through a difficult time and need some emotional support, you might find it useful to talk about what you're feeling. If you have people close to you, try reaching out to them. Loneliness affects almost everyone, so they'll probably be able to empathise.
 
 If you'd rather talk to someone who isn't close to you, there are organisations that can help, such as:
 
 * The Silver Line -  a free helpline providing emotional support and advice to older people
 
 * Cruse Bereavement Care - for support after the death of someone close
 
 * Relate - for help if you're experiencing difficulties in your relationships
 
 * Samaritans - free, confidential emotional support. You don't have to be depressed or suicidal to call them - they'll talk about anything that's worrying you.
 
 Volunteers to visit or call you
 
 You may just want some company or a chat on the phone with someone. There are many organisations that offer befriending schemes, including Independent Age. If you find it difficult to get out and about, a volunteer can visit or call weekly or fortnightly for a chat.
 
 Other organisations that offer befriending services include Age UK, the Royal Voluntary Service and The Silver Line.
 
 Our Staying connected page has more ideas on how you can boost your social contact.
 
 Partners and loneliness
 
 For some people, the loss or lack of a partner can be the hardest thing to cope with. You may have people around you but miss having one person to share your life with. Being single and lonely can be very difficult. You might feel you want to put all your energy into meeting new people. But learning to spend time alone and building other supportive relationships can help you to feel less lonely, whether or not you're looking for a partner.
 
 If you do feel ready to start a new relationship or friendship, there are many ways to meet people. Joining a group can be a good way to spend time with others and get to know them at a pace that suits you. See Staying connected for some ideas of groups you could join. Some people also try online dating - an increasingly popular way for people of all ages to meet new partners. 
 
 Learning to be alone
 
 This may feel like the opposite of what you should be doing but being on your own is different from being lonely. Learning to enjoy your own company can help you to feel less lonely even when you don't have others around you.
 
 Try using your time alone to learn a new skill or indulge an interest your friends don't share.
 
 If you find it hard to relax, you may find it helpful to practise mindfulness. This involves focusing your mind on the present moment, for example by concentrating on your breathing. Mind has more information.
 
 Spending time outdoors - even looking out of a window - can help you feel connected and ease feelings of loneliness.
 
 If you want more company at home, you could consider getting a pet. Many people find them very comforting. Having a dog that needs walking would also give you a reason to get out and keep active. If you wouldn't be able to keep your own dog, you could sign up to look after or walk one for someone else through organisations like The Cinnamon Trust or Borrow My Doggy.

 Staying connected to other people is good for your health and wellbeing. As you get older, you might find yourself with fewer day-to-day opportunities to meet others. However, there are practical things you can do to stay connected and lots of organisations to help you.
 
 Benefits of social interaction
 
 Having a network of good relationships improves our wellbeing and can keep our minds active. Staying connected with others and taking part in social activities can increase your confidence and improve your self-esteem.
 
 As you get older, certain changes can make it harder for you to stay socially active. For example:
 
 ? retirement may have reduced the number of people you see on a daily basis
 
 ? adult children may have moved away
 
 ? health difficulties or a lack of money may make it harder to get out.
 
 It's normal to find yourself alone at some points and being alone doesn't always mean you'll feel lonely. But not getting the quality or quantity of social contact you want can lead to feelings of loneliness, which can affect your physical and mental health. For more information on loneliness, see our webpage Coping with loneliness.
 
 Whether you want to stay in touch with old friends, make new friends and acquaintances, or be engaged with social activities, a few simple steps can help you to get the social contact you would like.
 
 During the coronavirus pandemic, you may not be able to go out and socialise the way you're used to. Our webpage Staying connected and well when you're staying at home has tips on how to stay in touch with others during this time, as well as support you can get.
 
 Ways to stay in touch
 
 While meeting people face-to-face is important, it might not always be easy or convenient to meet up as often as you'd like. Technology can help you stay in regular contact with friends and family, as well as giving you the opportunity to connect with others.
 
 Phone and video calls are a great way to stay in touch, especially if your friends or family live far away. You could schedule a call at a regular time every week - like putting a plan in the diary, this can give you something to look forward to. If it's hard to arrange a time to call people, consider other ways of communicating. You could send letters, emails or text messages instead. You could also consider joining social media sites, so you can keep up to date and connected with everyone close to you.
 
 If you don't have someone close to keep in touch with, there are plenty of charities that offer friendly, regular chats. For example, we provide a phone call service for people to regularly talk to one of our trained volunteers. Re-engage has a call companions service for older people who live alone and would like a friendly phone call every week or so.
 
 As well as helping you to keep connected with friends and family, the internet can be a great way to meet new friends or get back in touch with old ones. If you've fallen out of touch with friends, social networking sites like Facebook can be useful for reconnecting. Online forums can be a good way to find people with similar interests and chat with people across the UK and the world. For example, Gransnet (not just for grans) is an online social forum for anyone over 50.
 
 Social groups and activities
 
 Joining a social group or taking part in an activity can help you to meet new people and make friends. As well as the opportunity to socialise, it's a great way to continue with your hobbies, learn skills and pick up new interests.
 
 Don't feel you have to do things that are just for older people - there are many possibilities. Do something you know you enjoy or try something new. You could:
 
 * join social groups, such as Men's Sheds or the Women's Institute, which offer spaces in your local community to enjoy activities and meet other people
 
 * take part in exercise classes with Extend, which provides seated and standing exercise classes for all fitness levels. You could join walking groups, such as the Ramblers or Walking for Health, or take part in other physical activities such as swimming
 
 * do something you enjoy - for example, you can search for amateur music groups at Making Music or find a local bridge club at the English Bridge Union
 
 * learn something new at adult education classes or the University of the Third Age
 
 * attend an event at Re-engage, which hosts monthly Sunday afternoon tea parties for older people in local communities 
 
 * volunteer, to meet others while sharing your experience and doing something valuable. Many charities, including Independent Age, need volunteers, or you could contact Volunteering Matters or NCVO. You could combine your hobby with volunteering - for example, you could knit for a variety of charities!
 
 It's a good idea to plan ahead - putting things in the diary or calendar can give yourself a structure and something to look forward to. Our factsheet How to stay socially connected has more suggestions.
 
 During the coronavirus pandemic, many organisations are now hosting their events and activities online or on the phone. If you used to attend a group or class or would like to start, you should get in touch with the organiser to see what they're doing during this time.
 
 You can still enjoy many activities, such as online exercise classes, educational talks and virtual meetups with interest groups. For example, Royal Voluntary Service has a Virtual Village Hall where you can take part in online sessions about arts and crafts, cooking, gardening and more.
 
 Other practical steps
 
 There are lots of small, practical steps that can help you stay connected. Try some of the following suggestions.
 
 * For many people, keeping in touch by phone is a good way to overcome loneliness and get regular social contact with others. Make sure you're on the best tariff or call package.
 
 * Reach out to other people. You are probably not the only one who feels lonely. If you enjoy doing something like going to the cinema or taking part in an online class, try taking the first step and inviting someone to do it with you.
 
 * Going out can be expensive. If you're over 60, you may be entitled to discounts at cinemas, theatres, museums and more, so don't forget to ask. Also make sure you are claiming all the benefits you are entitled to. Call our Helpline on 0800 319 6789 for a free benefits check.
 
 Remember to look after yourself. Eating well, staying active and getting a good night's sleep can help you relax, feel better and feel more like socialising with others.
 
 Next steps
 
 If you'd like regular social contact from someone, you could think about receiving regular phone calls or visits from one of our trained volunteers. Call us on 0800 319 6789 to learn more.

 About this guide
 
 Most of us will feel lonely at some point. Being alone doesn't always mean you'll feel lonely - people often choose to spend time alone and enjoy their own company. Others may feel lonely even when surrounded by people. Loneliness is the feeling of sadness that can come from not having the social contact you would like.
 
 Some common experiences of older age could make you more likely to feel lonely. For example, adult children may have moved away, friends or partners may have died, and health problems may make it harder to get out and see others.
 
 Loneliness is a personal experience and people find different ways to overcome these feelings. This guide has advice on simple things to try which could help reduce loneliness, and information on where to look for more help.
 
 In this guide you'll find references to our other publications. You can order them by calling 0800 319 6789 or visiting independentage.org/ publications.
 
 Why am I lonely?
 
 People feel lonely for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes, a particular event or change in circumstances may trigger these feelings, or you may have felt lonely for a long time without really knowing why.
 
 You might find yourself feeling lonely if:
 
 ? a close relative or friend has died
 
 ? you have lost contact with friends or family
 
 ? a relationship has broken down
 
 ? you no longer work and miss the social contact this provided
 
 ? you live alone
 
 ? you've moved to a new country or area
 
 ? you have an illness which makes you feel isolated from others, either emotionally or because it makes it hard for you to get out
 
 ? you're caring for someone and don't have much opportunity to socialise
 
 ? you don't feel close to those around you
 
 ? you're living on a low income and can't afford to socialise as much as you'd like
 
 ? you don't feel supported by your relationships
 
 ? you have one close relationship but have lost touch with others
 
 ? you're shy or have social anxiety
 
 ? you're feeling depressed.
 
 These are just a few examples of why people feel lonely. Your loneliness may not have a direct cause and you don't need to look for one.
 
 However, it could help to be aware of when you're feeling lonely. You may find you feel lonely on certain days or at certain times, or that particular things trigger these feelings. For example, many people find Sunday the loneliest day because of its traditional reputation as a day to spend with family. If you're aware of what brings on your loneliness, you can try to change things to improve this.
 
 You could try keeping a simple journal to record how you're feeling at different times in the week. Think about things you've enjoyed, things you've found difficult and whether certain days or times of day are better than others:
 
 Try keeping the journal for a week and see if there's one thing you could change to make a difference. For example, if you find you're
 
 loneliest at the weekend because family aren't available to chat, consider signing up for a weekend event like the monthly Sunday tea party groups that are organised by Re-engage (0800 716543, reengage.org.uk). Or if you feel better on days when you've done a certain activity - such as cooking yourself a nice meal or taking a walk - try to do that more regularly.
 
 Thinking about yourself
 
 When you're lonely, especially if you've been feeling that way for a while, it can be hard to reach out. You might worry that others won't understand you or want to spend time with you. Learning to feel comfortable with yourself and increase your self-confidence can be an important first step. Sometimes, you may need to address underlying feelings and anxieties before trying to spend more time with others.
 
 Otherwise, simply increasing the amount of social contact you have may not change how you feel, at least in the short-term.
 
 If your confidence is low, engaging with other people can be particularly difficult. Try to challenge negative thoughts and remember to be kind to
 
 yourself. You might want to make a list of things you like about yourself or that other people have complimented you on. You may find this difficult or silly to start with, but it can be a useful tool. It can help you to understand yourself and what you value, as well as increasing your confidence.
 
 If you're feeling bad about yourself or anxious about how to change things, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could help. This teaches you to break negative or unhelpful thought patterns. It can help you to challenge assumptions like 'No one will want to talk to me' or 'I've been lonely for so long - nothing will change'. There are a number of self-help books and online resources available which use this approach. You can refer yourself to be assessed for a counselling service on the NHS by visiting nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-psychological- therapies-service, or you can ask your GP to refer you.
 
 You could try:
 
 ? The Overcoming series of self-help books, recommended by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Titles include Overcoming Anxiety and Overcoming Low Self-Esteem
 
 - nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety- depression/self-help-therapies has more information, or they're available from libraries and bookshops.
 
 ? The online mood self-assessment tool available on the NHS site (nhs.uk/conditions/ stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self- assessment). There is also lots of helpful advice on the site about how to deal with common mental health concerns, like low mood, low confidence and anxiety.
 
 Self-help isn't right for everyone. If you think you need some support, speak to your GP.
 
 If you're feeling very anxious or depressed or struggling to control your feelings of loneliness, talk to your GP or call a helpline like Samaritans (116 123) to talk about what's worrying you. There are also organisations that can help with specific problems, such as:
 
 ? Cruse Bereavement Care (0808 808 1677, cruse.org.uk)
 
 ? Relate for relationship counselling
 
 (0300 100 1234, relate.org.uk) - there's usually a charge for counselling sessions
 
 ? The Silver Line (0800 4 70 80 90, thesilverline. org.uk) - a helpline specifically for older people, providing emotional support and advice.
 
 Although loneliness and depression are distinct experiences, the two things are linked and one can lead to the other. Our guide Dealing with depression has more information about where to go for help and things you can do to help yourself stay mentally well.
 
 Talking about how you're feeling
 
 Opening up to others about how you're feeling can help you to feel less alone. If you have people around you but feel disconnected from them, try to talk to them about how you're feeling. It's easy to think that no one understands or cares what you're going through, but that's unlikely to be true.
 
 The vast majority of people have experienced loneliness, so should be able to empathise.
 
 If you don't feel comfortable talking to people  you know, you could try a support group instead. Many exist online and there may also be face-to- face groups in your area - ask your GP if they can recommend one. They may be for people with a certain illness or in a particular situation.
 
 For example:
 
 ? Mind offers support for anyone with mental health concerns (0300 123 3393, mind.org.uk). They also have an anonymous online forum called Elefriends, for people to talk about their lives and help others (elefriends.org.uk)
 
 ? Carers UK offers support if you're caring for someone (0808 808 7777, carersuk.org)
 
 ? Macmillan offers support to people affected
 
 by cancer (0808 808 00 00, macmillan.org.uk)
 
 ? Parkinson's UK offers support to people affected by Parkinson's (0808 800 0303, parkinsons.org.uk).
 
 It can be really reassuring to talk to people who have had similar experiences.
 
 Looking for opportunities
 
 Start by thinking about your current friends, family and acquaintances. Are there people you would like to talk to but have fallen out of contact with, or people who you would like to get to know better? If the idea of a face-to-face meeting or phone call feels too daunting, you could send them a letter or email. Sometimes just thinking about the people you know, who care about you, could help you to feel less isolated.
 
 If you don't have an existing group of people you're close to, think about the people you encounter in your day-to-day life. There may be opportunities to make new acquaintances this way. Perhaps you could say hello to a neighbour if you see them outside or chat to the newsagent
 
 who sells you your daily newspaper. You don't have to be close to someone for a conversation to be meaningful. Any encounter has the potential to make you feel more connected to those around you, even if it doesn't develop into a long-lasting friendship. As a first step, just being around other people without talking to them can help you to feel more connected. You could try going to the local park, a cinema, café or public event.
 
 If people don't always respond to you, don't take it personally. You're making a conscious effort to connect with other people, but they could have their minds on other things. Maybe they've had a bad day or are very busy. If one person rebuffs you, don't shy away from everyone. If you take every opportunity to smile or say hello, you're more likely to get a positive response from someone.
 
 Try setting yourself targets for the week and building up slowly:
 
 This week I will...
 
 ? Phone Ann for a chat
 
 ? Say hello to the new neighbours
 
 Achieved?

 Overcoming practical barriers
 
 There are many reasons why you may find it difficult to connect with people in the way you want to. Some of these might relate to how you're feeling, but others might be about the practical problems of getting out and about.
 
 It's worth thinking about what your practical barriers are, as you may find help is available to get round these difficulties. For example:
 
 I've given up driving. How can I get around?
 
 You could see if your area has a Dial-a-Ride scheme, which offers door-to-door transport to people who can't use public transport.
 
 Contact your local council or the Community Transport Association (0345 130 6195, ctauk.org/find-ct-provider). If you can use public transport, make sure you take advantage of discounts for over-60s - for example, you could purchase a Senior Railcard or Coachcard for a third off most train or coach journeys - and claim your free bus
 
 pass once you reach the qualifying age (gov.uk/apply-for-elderly-person-bus-pass or ask your local council).
 
 I don't have the money to go out with my friends.
 
 Make sure you're claiming all the benefits you're entitled to. Pension Credit is one that is very under-claimed and you just need to call the Pension Service on 0800 99 1234 to check if
 
 you qualify. Use our online benefits calculator (independentage.org/benefit-calculator) or call our Helpline on 0800 319 6789 to make an appointment for a full benefit check. Our free guide Moneywise has lots of tips on boosting your income. Going out doesn't have to be expensive - community groups and charities
 
 may offer free events near you. Remember to ask about age-related discounts when you go out  too, for example at the theatre or cinema.
 
 My wife needs 24-hour care. I just can't leave the house.
 
 Caring for someone can be very isolating. Ask your local council for a free carer's assessment as soon as possible. The council has a duty to carry this out for anyone who is an unpaid carer for a relative or friend. It looks at what support you need in your caring role and how you can get it (0800 319 6789, independentage.org/support-for-carers). Carer support groups can also be a great source of help
 
 - see page 12. You should also ask for a care needs assessment for the person you care for if they haven't had one recently.
 
 Your physical health
 
 Loneliness and isolation can have a severe impact on your health, so make sure you're looking after yourself. Eating sensibly, getting enough sleep and being active can all have a positive effect on your outlook and sense of wellbeing as well as your physical health. Try to avoid drinking too much alcohol, as this can make you feel more depressed. You can use a journal - see chapter 1 - to keep track of what you do and what you eat, and the impact this has on how you feel.
 
 Being unwell, particularly with a long-term illness, can lead to isolation. You may have a disability which makes it hard for you to get out, or think that others don't understand how you're feeling or what you're capable of. If you have friends and family around you, try to talk to them about how you're feeling. They may be able to help you get the companionship you need, or just provide reassurance that they're sympathetic to what you're going through.
 
 There are also many support groups for people affected by illnesses or conditions. They can be an invaluable source of encouragement and moral support - see chapter 2.
 
 Loneliness and coronavirus (COVID-19)
 
 Staying at home because of the pandemic may have increased your feelings of loneliness. Even if you live with other people, relationships can become strained and you may be feeling lonely.
 
 Much of the advice in this guide still applies, but you may need to make more effort to stay in touch with people. Having regular contact with family or friends can make a big difference to how you feel.
 
 If there's no one you can talk to, you could call a helpline such as The Silver Line - see chapter 2. Many organisations have adapted to the crisis by setting up online and phone groups. Keep busy by joining activities that focus on something you enjoy. See chapter 5 for suggestions of things you could try.
 
 Having a structure to your day can help you feel more in control. Try to stick to a routine and don't think too far ahead. Plan something to look forward to every day, such as a phone call, watching a film or baking something special.
 
 If you're feeling anxious, limit looking at the news to certain times of the day and only look at trusted sources. You might find it helpful to try meditation, mindfulness or relaxation exercises. See our guide Managing anxiety.
 
 Ways to stay in touch
 
 There are a lot of ways to stay in touch these days, even if you find it hard to leave your home. Phone calls can be very satisfying, but if it's hard to find a good time to ring relatives, try emailing them or sending a text message or letter instead. If you've lost touch with old friends, try using a social networking site like Facebook to reconnect.
 
 When you've become socially isolated, for whatever reason, it can be hard to make contact with people again - finding a means of communication that really works for you can help nudge you back into the habit of staying in touch.
 
 Online forums can be a great way to get in touch with people with similar interests. For example, Gransnet is a social networking site for over-50s. There are discussions on everything from genealogy to cooking and biscuit dunking.
 
 If you've got a special interest, you could search for online forums related to that. Most forums will have rules, and advice on how to use them safely, but it's important to use common sense when talking to strangers online. Our webpage independentage.org/information/personal- life/staying-safe-online has useful tips.
 
 Hazel's story
 
 Hazel bought her first computer 13 years ago after her husband died. She says, ""I was feeling a bit lonely and my daughter suggested I get a computer. I took computer courses through my local council. I went partly for the company, but mainly because I like learning new things. It's made a great difference because instead of just sitting at
 
 home watching television every night, I'm sat talking to friends online.""
 
 If you're not a confident internet user, the Online Centres Network can help you find free or low-cost local courses on getting online
 
 (0114 349 1666, onlinecentresnetwork.org) or visit learnmyway.com. AbilityNet has a free technical support helpline for older and disabled people (abilitynet.org.uk, 0800 048 7642).
 
 If what you'd really like is face-to-face contact, then try to arrange that instead. It may be easier to phone someone, but it's important to get the type of social contact that will help you, as well as the right amount.
 
 You can use the internet to make new friends. Websites like meetup.com and 4m8sonly.co.uk let you search for and contact people with similar interests in your area. If you do plan on meeting up with a friend you meet online, make sure you stay safe. See page 29 for more information.
 
 Trying something new
 
 Sometimes, the easiest way to break the cycle of loneliness is to meet new people. If you're trying to find new friends with whom you have more  in common, you could join a group based on an interest or hobby, such as:
 
 ? a local choir or orchestra
 
 ? a painting or drawing class
 
 ? a community gardening group
 
 ? a walking or swimming group
 
 ? a reading group
 
 ? a dance or tai chi class
 
 ? an LGBT group
 
 ? services or groups at a place of worship.
 
 These types of groups will exist in most areas, but be imaginative. If you've always fancied flower arranging or playing the ukulele, see what's available! If you'd like to learn or try something new, the University of the Third Age (U3A) has local centres in many areas, which offer a wide range of free or low-cost clubs and classes for older people (020 8466 6139, u3a.org.uk).
 
 You could also search online for courses on findcourses.co.uk. These are not free but there may be concessions. Joining a group that keeps you active can be particularly beneficial, as exercise can boost your mood as well as keeping you in good health.
 
 Look out for what is happening in your local area - there may be community events like village fairs you can get involved with, or talks offered by your local library. Your local council may also be able to recommend local day centres for older or disabled people, which will offer a range of activities. If you find it hard to get out
 
 or you live in an isolated area, try online groups instead. Many clubs will also have online equivalents - for example, there are a number of online reading groups.
 
 One advantage of joining a group based around an activity is that there may be less pressure to speak to people immediately. Some groups might even let you sit in on a meeting before you join in. Take any new experiences at a pace that suits you. You may have to try a few things before you find one that suits you, and it can take time to build trust with any new people you meet.
 
 Partners and loneliness
 
 I am almost 88 but amazingly healthy and apparently appear much younger! I was widowed many years ago. My problem, really, is a feeling of redundancy. I have a good relationship with my three children and six grandchildren, but in some ways it would be unhealthy if they still needed me. I am not shy and am happy in a group but that is not what I need. I just want one person to care about and who cares about me.
 
 For some people, the loss or lack of a partner can be the hardest thing to cope with. They may have a strong network of friends and family but find that they miss being part of a couple. This can be very hard, perhaps especially if you've
 
 lost a partner and are adjusting to spending more time on your own. You may feel you want to put all your energy into finding someone new - however, it can help to focus on other aspects of your life too. Learning to be alone and to develop other interests and supportive relationships can help you to feel less lonely and increase your sense of self-worth, whether or not you're looking for a partner.
 
 If you've lost a partner, it's normal to feel lonely and bereft. Give yourself time to come to terms with what has happened and how you're feeling. If you've been bereaved, grief causes many different feelings and may stay with you for a long time. Allow yourself the time you need to adjust. If you're feeling overwhelmed, Cruse Bereavement Care may be able to help
 
 (0808 808 1677, cruse.org.uk/bereavement- services/get-help). Our free guide Coping with bereavement has more advice on living with grief and loss.
 
 Divorce is becoming more common among older people and there is less stigma attached to it these days. While it may be the best outcome when a relationship breaks down, it can also lead to loneliness. You may have lost some of your social networks, your relationships with your children may be affected and there can be a financial cost as well. It can take time to work through the issues that come with divorce
 
 and it may be helpful to talk to someone. An organisation such as Relate can help - you don't have to be in a relationship to seek advice
 
 (0300 100 1234, relate.org.uk/relationship-help/ help-separation-and-divorce).
 
 If you feel ready to start a new relationship, there are many ways to meet new people. Building close relationships can take time, so don't be disheartened if it doesn't happen immediately.
 
 If the idea of meeting someone new feels daunting, you might want to start by taking up a new hobby or activity. Joining a group activity would let you spend time with others and start to talk to them at a pace that suits you.
 
 Some people try online dating - an increasingly popular way for people of all ages to meet new partners. This can be very convenient and is usually safe, but be careful when giving out personal information or arranging to meet people for the first time. Mind, the mental health charity, has advice on staying safe
 
 online and having healthy online relationships (0300 123 3393, mind.org.uk/information- support/tips-for-everyday-living/online- mental-health/online-relationships).
 
 Our relationship webpages independentage.org/information/personal- life/relationships have more advice on dating and relationships in later life.
 
 Learning to be alone
 
 If you're feeling lonely, you may try to avoid spending time alone. However, being on your own is not the same as being lonely. Learning to feel comfortable with your own company can help you to feel less lonely even when you don't have others around you.
 
 Spending time apart from others can be a liberating experience - you can use it to do things you enjoy. You might want to cultivate a new skill or indulge an interest your friends don't share. If you find it hard to relax or
 
 concentrate on what you're doing, you could try mindfulness (mind.org.uk/mindfulness). This is a way of focusing your mind on the present moment. For instance, you might focus on your breathing. It's a useful tool to help manage your thoughts and feelings.
 
 Some people compare themselves to others, and worry that they have a lonelier life than those around them. Try not to do this. One of the drawbacks of social media, such as Facebook,
 
 is that we seem to have a constant window into other people's lives. You may see pictures of
 
 people surrounded by friends and family, but this doesn't show the full picture - people often only share the positive parts of their lives. Try to focus on yourself and how you are feeling rather than making comparisons. Not everyone needs the same number of companions or type of social contact.
 
 If you want more companionship at home, you could consider getting a pet. Pets can provide unconditional love and company and many people find them very comforting. Having a dog that needs walking can also give you a reason
 
 to go outside and do something active. If you wouldn't be able to keep your own dog, you could help someone out by walking or looking after their dog through organisations like
 
 The Cinnamon Trust (01736 757 900, www.cinnamon.org.uk) or Borrow My Doggy (020 3826 8628, borrowmydoggy.com).
 
 Helping others
 
 Volunteering works both ways - you're helping other people or a cause you care about, but you can get a lot from it too. Most volunteers find it a very rewarding experience and it can be a great way to meet other people with similar interests. Some people find that their loneliness stems from a feeling that they're not needed. Choosing to do something that makes a difference challenges that perception and can make you feel less isolated.
 
 Have a look at the volunteering opportunities available in your area - many of them won't require particular skills. For example:
 
 ? The Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme helps over-50s find opportunities to use their skills and experience in the community
 
 (020 3780 5870, volunteeringmatters.org.uk/ pillars/older-people)
 
 ? Do-it.org lets you search for volunteering opportunities in your area, so is a good place to start if you're online
 
 ? Re-engage hosts afternoon tea parties for over-75s. They need volunteer drivers
 
 and hosts, or you could sign up as a guest
 
 (0800 716543, reengage.org.uk)
 
 ? Organisations such as Independent Age look for volunteers to make regular phone calls or visits to older people. You could sign up as a volunteer or request phone calls or visits for yourself (020 7605 4255, independentage.org/ volunteer).
 
 John's story
 
 ""My wife and I were married for 63 years. When she died a few years ago, I fell into a depression. I had this feeling of loneliness, emptiness and uncertainty. I couldn't plan anything; I felt lost. My two daughters were kind, but it is so difficult when you have been with someone for such a long time and they are no longer there.
 
 ""What finally saved me was making a lot of friends in the village. One in particular, Mary, encouraged me to meet people. She made me realise that I had to think about the future; it was no good spending all my time looking back.
 
 Thanks to Mary I started going out more.
 
 I love cooking so I made cakes for local coffee mornings. Once I got to know people there,
 
 I invited them home for lunch.
 
 ""I also asked Independent Age for a volunteer to visit me. Andrew and I always have a chat and a laugh. It's what you need. We both have engineering backgrounds which gives us
 
 a lot to talk about.
 
 34
 
 ""Besides talking about work, we have a chat about family, we discuss things on the telly.
 
 Having a visitor has given me pleasures that I wouldn't have had.
 
 Andrew's someone
 
 I can rely on. His visits break up my day and mean I see someone I wouldn't normally see.
 
 ""I've realised that when
 
 I have nothing to do, I sit and think - and then I
 
 feel lonely. I know now I have to keep myself busy. I do believe that's the answer for all of us.""

 About this guide
 
 We all feel sad from time to time. But as we get older, changes in our lives, for example, bereavement, illness or retirement, can make
 
 us more vulnerable to low moods or depression. This may mean we need a bit of extra support, but it's important to remember that poor mental health is not an inevitable part of ageing. If you're struggling to cope, help is available.
 
 This guide explains what mental health is and what might make you vulnerable to depression. It also has guidance on where you can go for help, and things you can do to help yourself and stay well.
 
 In this guide you'll find references to our other publications. You can order them by calling 0800 319 6789 or visiting independentage.org/publications.
 
 What is mental health?
 
 Your mental health describes your emotional wellbeing - how you think and feel, and how you deal with everyday stresses. It's just as important as your physical health, and like your physical health it can get better or worse over time. Your mental health can change with your situation and as you move into different stages of your life.
 
 If you do experience low mood or depression, you're not alone. Depression affects around one in five older people. It's important to talk about how you feel and seek help. Treatments can be very effective, even if you've been feeling low for a long time, and there are lots of different options available.
 
 What is depression?
 
 Depression is a common mental health problem. It can be hard to know if you're experiencing depression because the symptoms may seem like exaggerated forms of everyday emotions.
 
 Depression varies from person to person, but no matter how it affects you, it is a real illness.
 
 What causes depression?
 
 As you get older, life changes and losses can challenge good mental health, making you more vulnerable to low mood and depression. A period of depression might be caused by:
 
 ? ill health, including long-term health conditions
 
 ? bereavement
 
 ? loss of daily routine following retirement
 
 ? loneliness, isolation and loss of friendship networks
 
 ? loss of purpose
 
 ? moving house
 
 ? moving into a care home
 
 ? loss of income or money worries
 
 ? becoming a carer
 
 ? relationship breakdown
 
 ? loss of confidence or low self-esteem.
 
 There could also be physical health causes, such as thyroid problems, certain vitamin deficiencies, side effects of medications (especially a combination of medications), or head injuries.
 
 Sometimes, there may be no obvious cause at all.
 
 Preparing for changes you know will happen, such as moving house, and thinking about how you will adjust to them, could make the transition easier.
 
 Depression and anxiety
 
 Some symptoms of depression can overlap with anxiety, and there are some similar treatments. It is possible to experience both at the same time. See our guide Managing anxiety for more information on ways to cope with anxiety.
 
 Depression and dementia
 
 Depression and dementia share some of the same symptoms, including  memory  problems or difficulty concentrating. You may worry you're suffering from dementia when you're actually depressed. The shared symptoms can also make it harder to diagnose depression if you already have dementia. If you're worried about either condition, talk to your GP or contact the Alzheimer's Society (0333 150 3456, alzheimers.org.uk).
 
 How you might feel
 
 A low mood that doesn't lift may be a sign of depression. However, depression isn't just about low mood. You may experience the following:
 
 Thoughts and feelings
 
 ? loss of interest in life, including things you previously enjoyed
 
 ? feeling helpless or hopeless
 
 ? worrying or feeling anxious
 
 ? feeling irritable or angry
 
 ? difficulty concentrating
 
 ? problems with your memory
 
 ? feeling bored or restless
 
 ? being irritable with other people, or avoiding them
 
 ? being very tearful
 
 ? thoughts of self-harm or wanting to end your life
 
 ? feeling you've let yourself or others down
 
 ? feeling guilty.
 
 Physical symptoms and behaviour changes
 
 Older people with depression usually have more physical symptoms. These can include:
 
 ? trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
 
 ? over- and under-eating or loss of appetite
 
 ? having no energy and feeling tired for no reason
 
 ? loss of interest in sex
 
 ? dizziness and faintness
 
 ? constipation.
 
 Some of these symptoms can also be caused by physical illnesses, which can make it harder to identify depression as the cause. If you have a long-term illness or multiple illnesses, this can make it especially difficult. Speak to your GP or healthcare professional if you have any troubling symptoms - see chapter 4.
 
 Good to know
 
 The NHS website has a depression self- assessment tool, which might be useful: nhs.uk/conditions/clinical-depression
 
 When to seek help
 
 Often, periods of low mood won't last very long.
 
 If there is an obvious cause, your mood may lift once the problem is resolved. However, you might want to consider support if:
 
 ? you have negative feelings that continue
 
 for more than two weeks or are getting worse
 
 ? the symptoms are interfering with your daily life
 
 ? you're having thoughts of self-harm or thinking that life is not worth living
 
 ? your family and friends are worried
 
 ? you've fixed a practical problem that may have triggered your depression, but still feel down.
 
 If your feelings of depression are particularly strong, you should consider speaking to your GP - see chapter 4.
 
 If you feel you can't go on
 
 If you start feeling life isn't worth living or that you want to harm yourself, seek help immediately. Contact your GP for an urgent
 
 appointment or call NHS 111. Or call Samaritans on 116 123 for 24-hour confidential support.
 
 Where to go for help
 
 If you're experiencing depression, it can feel hard to ask for help. You might be nervous opening up to someone, but depression isn't something you have to go through alone.
 
 Support is available and getting the right treatment sooner rather than later can help you to start feeling better again.
 
 Find a good listener
 
 Talking to friends, family or someone you trust about how you're feeling is a good first step. If you're going to speak to your GP, you might also find it helpful to have someone else with you.
 
 Another option is to try a helpline for emotional or mental health support, such as:
 
 ? The Silver Line (0800 470 8090, thesilverline. org.uk)
 
 ? Samaritans (116 123, samaritans.org)
 
 ? Rethink Mental Illness (0300 5000 927, rethink.org)
 
 ? Mind (0300 123 3393, mind.org.uk).
 
 The first two helplines are free and available 24 hours a day.
 
 Talk to your doctor
 
 If your low mood continues or you're struggling to cope, speak to your GP. They can assess your needs and suggest treatments, such as counselling, medication or steps you can take to help yourself. The appointment could be over the phone or face-to-face.
 
 Before the appointment
 
 It's a good idea to write down everything you want to say to your GP, and check it off during the appointment. Our medical appointment planner can help with this. Find it in our Living well with long-term health conditions guide, or on our website (independentage.org/preparing- for-medical-appointments).
 
 Remember, you don't have to have physical symptoms to speak to your GP about your health.
 
 During the appointment
 
 Your GP will ask you about how you're feeling and any other symptoms, and may make a diagnosis of depression. They may ask you
 
 to complete a written questionnaire as part of the assessment. If you want to, you can have
 
 a family member or friend with you for support.
 
 Treatment options
 
 Your GP will then discuss appropriate treatment options with you. These could include:
 
 ? talking therapies - such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy through the NHS psychological therapies (IAPT) service. These services are free, but they may be short- term and there is likely to be a waiting list. You can also refer yourself (nhs.uk/service-search/ find-a-psychological-therapies-service)
 
 ? medication - including different types of antidepressants. You should be told about how long you may need to take these for, and possible side effects. It's important to check that any new medication will work well with anything you're already taking
 
 ? self-help resources and activities - including support groups, books, online tools and exercise programmes
 
 ? a combination of these things.
 
 I felt awful but I didn't want to burden my friends or family with it, so I contacted the number my GP
 
 gave me and arranged an appointment with a therapist. I learnt lots of ways
 
 to deal with how I was feeling and what was happening to me. I could just say exactly what I felt without worrying, whereas you tend to
 
 put on a show for other people.
 
 Find a private counselling service
 
 You might want to do this if NHS waiting times are long, after you've finished a short course of NHS counselling, or for more choice. The cost can vary a lot, so it's worth looking around.
 
 Your GP should be able to help you find a therapist, or the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)
 
 has a searchable directory (01455 883300, bacp.co.uk/search/therapists). Make sure your therapist is accredited by a professional body, such as the BACP.
 
 Get support for specific problems
 
 If you've been through a painful event or are worried about a specific problem, there may be a specialist organisation that can help you with practical and emotional support. For example:
 
 ? Relate for relationship counselling - there's usually a charge for counselling sessions (0300 100 1234, relate.org.uk)
 
 ? Cruse Bereavement Care (0808 808 1677, cruse.org.uk)
 
 ? support groups for addiction and dependency, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (0800 917 7650, alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk)
 
 ? StepChange (0800 138 1111, stepchange. org) or National Debtline (0808 808 4000, nationaldebtline.org) for debt advice
 
 ? Shelter for housing advice (0808 800 4444, shelter.org.uk/get_advice).
 
 Support during coronavirus (COVID-19)
 
 It's especially important to take care of yourself during the pandemic and get help if you need it. If you're struggling to cope, consider trying to:
 
 ? talk to your GP - see page 11
 
 ? find out what practical support you can get
 
 - our coronavirus hub has more information on getting food and essentials, and changes to services (independentage.org/covid-19)
 
 ? make an extra effort to keep in touch with friends and family - see page 27
 
 ? use self-help tools - visit the Every Mind Matters website for ideas on caring for your mental health during the pandemic (nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters).
 
 Join a self-help group
 
 These are run by a number of organisations, including:
 
 ? Mind (0300 123 3393, mind.org.uk/ information-support/local-minds)
 
 ? Carers UK (0808 808 7777, carersuk.org/ local-support or carersuk.org/forum).
 
 You can also ask your GP about local mental health support groups. Some self-help groups are running online during the pandemic.
 
 Ways to help yourself
 
 There are lots of things you can do to look after yourself while you're feeling low, whether or not you're receiving help elsewhere.
 
 Talk to others and ask for help
 
 Don't accept low mood and depression as part of ageing - they're not. Make sure you talk to people you trust about how you're feeling and get the help you're entitled to through the NHS.
 
 Stay connected
 
 Depression may make you want to withdraw from others, but feeling lonely or isolated can contribute to feeling depressed. Try to stay in touch with people, even if it feels like an effort at first. Catching up with people and pursuing your interests and hobbies will help you to feel more positive. You could also consider getting more social contact by signing up for regular calls or visits from a volunteer - see chapter 6. Our guide If you're feeling lonely has more ideas for staying connected.
 
 Look after your physical health
 
 Try to eat healthily, and avoid drinking too much alcohol as this will affect your mood. Sleep patterns can change as we get older. If you're noticing more changes than usual,
 
 such as waking up frequently or taking longer to fall asleep, you may want to talk to your GP.
 
 Keep active
 
 You might not feel in the mood for exercising, but it's a good idea to keep doing as much as you can. Research shows it can boost your mood and self-confidence, and it can also help you to sleep better. See chapter 6 for activities you could try.
 
 Stick to your medication
 
 Make sure you follow your GP's advice on any medication you've been prescribed. If you want to reduce your dosage or come off your medication completely, talk to your GP first, even if you're feeling better. Coming off some medications, such as antidepressants, can cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them too quickly.
 
 St John's wort
 
 St John's wort is a popular herbal remedy for mild depression. If you're considering using it, speak to your GP first. It may not be a suitable treatment option for you and it can interact with some other medications, potentially causing health problems.
 
 Follow a self-help course
 
 Ask your GP or counsellor for recommendations of self-help resources, including books or online services. You could also ask about guided self- help. This typically involves using self-help resources while having your progress reviewed by a healthcare professional.
 
 The NHS website offers practical tools to help you with your mental health and wellbeing (nhs. uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/).
 
 Do things you enjoy
 
 Let yourself do things you enjoy, even if it might feel hard at the beginning. Giving yourself the odd treat, such as going out for a meal or watching your favourite film, can help raise your spirits.
 
 Take things a step at a time
 
 Getting better from depression can take time, so take things slowly. It's normal to have better and worse days. It can be harder to make decisions, so try to avoid making big changes, such as deciding to move house, until you feel more like yourself.
 
 Joan, 78
 
 ""I used to feel so lonely I'd sit at home and cry. I felt depressed and had no one to help me. I was divorced, my children had moved away and I had never expected to be living on my own. I have grandchildren but none of my family live near me.
 
 ""When I was depressed, I struggled to sleep. I'd have panic attacks and I'd want to call someone in the middle of the night so they could sit with me, but I couldn't talk to anyone. Then I'd panic more and feel my heart racing. So many of us feel isolated and alone.
 
 ""I went to my doctor about anti-depressants, but I decided they weren't for me.
 
 ""I called Independent Age and they arranged for a volunteer visitor to come and see me once a week. When she arrived for the first time, we clicked immediately. She just made me feel at ease. I always feel so much happier after we've spoken.
 
 ""A volunteer from another charity told me about a local day centre but I didn't feel I could go on my own. I didn't have any confidence.
 
 20
 
 She said she'd come with me for the first three times and little by little my confidence came back.
 
 ""At the day centre I met people as lonely as me and I talked and ate with them. Everyone there is so lovely. We talk to each other and hear what other people are going through, and I find that helps me.
 
 When other people are happy and laughing, I want to know how they do it, so I talk to them about what makes them happy. That helps me too.
 
 ""I would say to anyone who is feeling depressed to talk to other people. I find that's what has helped me. Any kind of talking therapy is the answer for so many of us. If
 
 I start to feel depressed now, I have people who I can call anytime and that helps me feel better.""

 Staying well
 
 Even if you're feeling completely well again, it's good to boost your emotional resilience and improve your mental health in the long term. If you know your life is going to change soon - for example, if you're thinking of moving to a new area away from good friends - you could start planning for this and thinking about how you can adjust to it.
 
 Set yourself targets
 
 Setting yourself some achievable goals can help you carry on doing things that will protect your mental health, make you feel good and give you a sense of satisfaction when you achieve them. Keep them realistic and build them up over time. They can be simple, specific things like, ""I will go for a walk today"" or ""I will ring my friend this week"". Don't worry if you don't always stick to your plans. If you can, try to identify what stopped you and what you could do differently next time.
 
 Exercise
 
 Staying active has a huge number of benefits. It can give you more energy, boost your mood by releasing feel-good chemicals in the brain, help you to sleep and eat properly, and generally improve your physical health. Find an activity that works for you, for example:
 
 ? gardening or housework
 
 ? walking or cycling - the NHS recommends two and a half hours a week of this level of activity for over-65s who are generally fit and healthy
 
 ? strength, flexibility and balance exercises - the NHS website has details of good ones for older people, including chair-based exercises (nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity- guidelines-older-adults)
 
 ? swimming or water aerobics
 
 ? yoga or tai chi
 
 ? dancing.
 
 You should talk to your GP before starting a new exercise routine, especially if you're not used to regular exercise. Your GP might be able to refer you for a formal exercise programme.
 
 Eat a balanced diet
 
 Like exercise, eating well can have a positive effect on how we feel. Aim for low-sugar foods and drinks, and avoid drinking too much alcohol. Try to eat regular meals and a balanced diet that includes:
 
 ? starchy foods, such as bread, rice, pasta or potatoes - go for wholegrain or brown options whenever you can, because they help keep you full for longer
 
 ? at least five portions of fruit and veg a day
 
 ? enough protein, for example, beans, pulses, fish, eggs or meat - try to have a little bit with every meal
 
 ? plenty of water - even slight dehydration can affect your mood, so aim for 6-8 glasses of water a day. Tea, coffee and juice also count but watch out for the caffeine or sugar content.
 
 NHS Eat well (nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well) has more information about eating a balanced diet.
 
 Increase your sense of purpose
 
 Volunteering is a great way to support a good cause, boost your self-esteem and meet new people. It can give you a sense of purpose and help you to feel less isolated. There are lots of different opportunities around, so find something to suit your skills and interests.
 
 ? Charities often need volunteers of all ages. For example, Independent Age looks for volunteers to make regular friendship phone calls or visits to older people (020 7605 4255, independentage.org/get-involved).
 
 ? The Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme helps older people find opportunities to use their skills and experience in the community (020 3780 5870, volunteeringmatters.org.uk/ pillars/older-people).
 
 ? Do-it.org lets you search for volunteering opportunities in your area, so it's a good place to start if you're online.
 
 Sign up for regular calls, visits or group activities
 
 If you're feeling lonely, you could think about asking for an Independent Age volunteer to visit or phone you on a regular basis. Contact Independent Age for more information (0800 319 6789, independentage.org/get-support).
 
 The Royal Voluntary Service also offers befriending services (0330 555 0310, royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk).
 
 Some groups organise regular social activities for older people. For example, Re-engage arranges monthly afternoon tea parties and reading groups (0800 716 543, reengage.org.uk). Groups may be meeting online or over the phone during the coronavirus pandemic.
 
 Seek companionship
 
 Staying in touch with people can help you feel happier and help keep things in perspective. If you can't meet in person, try a phone call, email or text message. If you're online, you could keep in touch through a video call by using free services such as Skype, or you could use Facebook or WhatsApp to send messages to friends and find people you've lost touch with.
 
 Pets can also be excellent companions, so you could consider getting a dog or cat. Many animal rehoming charities have dog walking programmes if you can't commit to a pet, or want to spend some time with one before getting your own. You can sign up to look after or walk someone else's dog through organisations such as The Cinnamon Trust (01736 757 900, www.cinnamon.org.uk) or
 
 Borrow My Doggy (020 3826 8628, borrowmydoggy.com). There's a small fee to sign up with the latter.
 
 Keep your mind active
 
 Read a book or newspaper, do crosswords or sudoku puzzles, play chess or card games, or learn a new skill. You could enrol on an adult learning course, a computer course at a local library, or take up a new sport or hobby. The University of the Third Age has many local branches which offer a wide range of free or low-cost clubs and classes for older people (020 8466 6139, u3a.org.uk).
 
 Learn to be alone
 
 Solitude can be just as important as staying connected. Being alone doesn't have to mean feeling lonely, so try to turn it into a rewarding experience.
 
 You could use some of your time alone to concentrate on yourself and make time for your own interests and the things you enjoy. You could pick up a new hobby or return to an old one, such as painting, building a collection or learning a musical instrument.
 
 You could also use it to practise mindfulness (mind.org.uk/mindfulness). This is a form of meditation where you focus on the present moment. For instance, you might focus on your breathing. It can be a useful tool to help manage your thoughts and feelings. Mindfulness might be recommended to you if you've had three or more periods of depression, but isn't recommended if you suffer from social anxiety. Ask your GP or therapist for advice before you try it alone.
 
 How to help someone you're worried about
 
 If you're worried about the mental health of a friend or relative, or think they may be depressed, there are things you can do to help them.
 
 Encourage them to seek help
 
 Reassure them that depression and low mood are common and can be treated successfully. You could also offer to be with them if they speak to their GP, as they may find it daunting to talk about their emotions when they're feeling vulnerable.
 
 What you can do to help
 
 ? Listen to what they say, without judging them. It can be hard to open up about difficult emotions, so let them know it's okay to talk. Don't force them to talk if they don't want to - just make it clear you'll be there when they need you.
 
 ? Don't dismiss their problems and resist telling them to 'cheer up'. Depression is an illness, so it's not as simple as this.
 
 ? Reassure them that how they're feeling is not their fault and it's treatable. Depression
 
 often makes people feel guilty and that they're letting others down, so they may be blaming themselves.
 
 ? Offer practical help if they're struggling to cope with daily tasks. For example, if they aren't eating properly, you could make them a meal.
 
 ? Keep in touch with them. Depression can increase isolation as people who are depressed often avoid others' company.
 
 ? Be patient and kind. It might take time for them to get help or start feeling better.
 
 Look after yourself
 
 This may be a stressful situation for you as well as them. Remember to look after your mental health and wellbeing too. If you're struggling, you could ask your GP for help and advice, or call helplines such as Samaritans (116 123, samaritans.org) or Mind (0300 123 3393, mind.org.uk).

66,1,"Understanding CAMHS - for young people
 
 A guide on what CAMHS are, how to to access them, and what to expect from your appointments.
 
 This page is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
 
 What are CAMHS?
 
 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) are services that support young people with their mental health. You may also hear them called CYPMHS (Children and Young People's Mental Health Services).
 
 On this page when we talk about CAMHS, we are talking about the free services run by the NHS, sometimes called Specialist CAMHS or Specialist CYPMHS.
 
 In some areas, your local CAMHS service may be called another name. If you're not sure, you can ask at your doctors surgery.
 
 On this page we have information on:
 
 ? Who does CAMHS support?
 
 ? What support do they offer?
 
 ? How can I get help from CAMHS?
 
 ? What if CAMHS won't help me?
 
 ? Will I have to wait for an appointment?
 
 ? What happens in my first appointment?
 
 ? Will they speak to my parents or carers?
 
 ? How long will CAMHS support me for?
 
 Who does CAMHS support?
 
 CAMHS services generally support young people experiencing:
 
 * sadness, low mood or depression
 
 * feelings of worry or anxiety
 
 * low confidence
 
 * problems with eating or your relationship with food
 
 * anger
 
 * problems sleeping
 
 * hearing voices or seeing things
 
 * thoughts about wanting to hurt yourself
 
 * difficult feelings after a traumatic event.
 
 ""I developed an anxiety disorder of crowded areas after losing a relative in the Manchester arena bombing.""
 
 What support and treatments do they offer?
 
 Your CAMHS team can offer support and treatments, like:
 
 * talking therapies, to explore your feelings - this might be on your own with a therapist or with your family there too
 
 * medication, to help you cope with how you feel
 
 * staying in hospital, for treatment and support - see our information hub on going into hospital to find out more.
 
 The type of help you get will be decided by your CAMHS team but you should be asked about what you would like and what you feel most comfortable with.
 
 What is talking therapy?
 
 Talking therapy, sometimes called counselling, is where you talk to a trained professional about your thoughts and feelings.
 
 There are lots of different types of therapy. For some, you might just talk about how you feel, but there are also arts and play therapies where you might explore your feelings by doing something creative, like drawing or playing games.
 
 You can talk to your CAMHS team about the types of therapy you might get and what you can expect.
 
 ""You may feel that you really should not be there... But the counsellors are there to help you and to enable you to leave feeling better supported to tackle the future.""
 
 How can I get help from CAMHS?
 
 How you get help from your local CAMHS service, might depend on where you live. Most services have their own website where you can find out more information.
 
 Normally you will need a referral from your doctor, but some services also accept referrals from schools, social workers, youth offending teams or yourself if you're old enough.
 
 How can I find my local service?
 
 If you live in England, you can find your local CAMHS service, see what support they offer and find out how to get their help by using the NHS search tool. Or if you live in Wales, you can visit your Local Health Board website.
 
 When CAMHS gets your referral they will contact you and your family, by phone or by sending you a letter, to give you an appointment or ask for more information about what you're experiencing.
 
 ""To have someone sit me down and tell me that 'yes, there is a real issue', was unbelievably validating.""
 
 What if CAMHS won't help me?
 
 Sometimes after speaking to you and your parents or carers to find out what support you need, CAMHS may decide that it's not the right service for you. This can be really upsetting and frustrating, especially if you've already waited a long time for your appointment and you're not getting the help you need.
 
 If this happens, they should suggest other places you can go for support or things you can try that might help.
 
 If you're struggling to get help from your local CAMHS service for any reason, you should speak to your doctor to find out what your options are and what other support you can get.
 
 You can also read our guide on finding support, which has information about the other types of help you might find useful.
 
 ""I felt like there was nothing else that would help except from CAMHS, when in reality, local charities and support from school can make the biggest difference.""
 
 Will I have to wait for an appointment?
 
 Sometimes if your local service is busy, you might have to wait a while for an appointment. This can be really upsetting and worrying, especially if you feel like things are getting worse.
 
 It might help to:
 
 * speak to your doctor about other support you can try while you wait.
 
 * contact the CAMHS service to ask when you should get an appointment and if there is anything you can do while you wait.
 
 * explore other options for support, like help from charity organisations. See our page on finding support for more information.
 
 ""We were told that it would take some time as the waiting lists are quite long. While waiting, I received support from my school counsellor.""
 
 What will happen in my first appointment?
 
 In your first appointment, you will meet someone from your CAMHS team. They might ask you questions about:
 
 * how you've been feeling
 
 * problems at school or at home
 
 * relationships with your family and friends
 
 * things you enjoy doing
 
 * things you would like help with.
 
 This is so they can understand how you're feeling and whether their service is right for you. If it is, they will work together with you and your family to decide what kind of support might help.
 
 To find out about the people who might work in your CAMHS team, Young Minds have information about the different professionals you might see and what they do.
 
 Questions to ask in your appointment
 
 You can ask about anything you're unsure of in your appointment. Having all of the information can make you feel more in control. It might help to ask:
 
 * What should I expect from CAMHS?
 
 * How many appointments will I get?
 
 * What treatments might I get?
 
 * How will it help me?
 
 * What do I do if I need urgent help?
 
 * Is there anything I can do to help myself?
 
 ""When I first went to CAMHS, I was terrified... I was convinced that needing help meant I was weak and pathetic. It took a while for me to realise that wasn't the case.""
 
 Will they speak to my parents or carers?
 
 Your CAMHS team normally talk to your parents or carers to understand more about you and your family, so they can help you in the best way they can. They might talk to them about what kind of help they could offer you and ask them to come along to appointments.
 
 If you're worried about your parents or carers coming to appointments with you or finding out what you've said, try to let your CAMHS team know and explain why this makes you uncomfortable. You can also ask them how much of what you say in your appointment stays between you and them.
 
 How long will CAMHS support me for?
 
 How long you're supported by CAMHS will be personal to you, but you can ask them for a guide at any time.
 
 If you're offered therapy you might be given a set number of appointments. After you've had these, your CAMHS team will talk to you about how things are going and how you're feeling. This will help you both decide whether you still need their support.
 
 CAMHS may also stop supporting you if you become too old for their service. In most places this is when you turn 18, but it can be earlier or later, depending on the service. See our guide on moving to adult services for more information.

71,1,"Confidence and self-esteem - for young people
 
 Information for young people about confidence and self-esteem, what can affect them, and tips to help you feel better about yourself.
 
 This page is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
 
 Confidence and self-esteem
 
 If we have high self-esteem, we feel good about ourselves. And if we feel confident, we feel like there are things we're good at. But sometimes, our confidence gets knocked, or we don't like ourselves very much.
 
 We can all feel like this at times, but when we feel like this for a long time, it can become a problem.
 
 Whatever affects your confidence or self-esteem, it's important to remember that you have the right to feel good about yourself. We're here to help you find a way.
 
 This page has information on:
 
 ? What is self-esteem?
 
 ? What is confidence?
 
 ? What can affect my confidence and self-esteem?
 
 ? How can I build my confidence and self-esteem?
 
 ? Where can I go for help and support?
 
 What is self-esteem?
 
 Your self-esteem is how you think and feel about yourself. Your self-esteem can affect how much you:
 
 * like and value yourself as a person
 
 * believe in yourself and the things you can do
 
 * stand up for yourself when under pressure
 
 * are willing to try new or difficult things
 
 * move on from mistakes without blaming yourself unfairly
 
 * believe you matter and are good enough
 
 * believe you deserve happiness.
 
 If you have high self-esteem, the way you think and feel about yourself is likely to be positive. But if you have low self-esteem, you may find that the way you think and feel about yourself is more negative, and you may feel less able to stand up for yourself.
 
 Example
 
 When Matt's self-esteem was low, he didn't feel like he was clever and he worried about the way he looked. He stopped trying in Maths lessons, as he thought he'd never be any good at Maths. He also stopped wearing clothes he liked, because he thought no-one would be interested in him.
 
 Matt then found a couple of new friends who dressed how he liked to. When he told them he was struggling with Maths, they offered to help him with any problems he was stuck on.
 
 Now Matt dresses how he wants, and feels good about it. He also finds it easier to keep trying in Maths lessons, even when he's finding things difficult.
 
 ""Something that can really affect our self-esteem and confidence are the people we surround ourselves with, especially our friends.""
 
 What is confidence?
 
 Confidence is about:
 
 * Believing in yourself, your abilities and ideas - this could be knowing a suggestion you have in class is a good one, feeling like you can learn a new song your band wants to perform, or knowing you can ask someone out without getting cold feet.
 
 * Understanding and accepting yourself for who you are - like being proud of your sexuality or hair colour, being okay with not being great at sports, or not wanting to change yourself to fit in with others.
 
 Confidence doesn't mean being 'outgoing'. You can be quiet or shy and still be confident. And even when someone's the loudest person in the room, that doesn't always mean they're feeling the most confident inside.
 
 Example
 
 Aneesa used to have little confidence in herself. Her mum and her friends all said she had a gift for writing but she felt embarrassed by it. She used to hide her stories and hope her English teacher wouldn't read her work out loud.
 
 Now Aneesa is building up her confidence and it's making a difference. She sticks motivational messages and pictures on her walls. She also keeps a list of nice comments anyone makes about her writing - so she can read them when she feels unsure of herself.
 
 Although Aneesa still doesn't want to read her stories out loud in class, she feels confident enough to submit a story to a national competition. She's really proud of how much her confidence has grown.
 
 ""I think accepting who you are and being proud of anything which makes you different is very important, there is only one version of yourself.""
 
 What can affect my confidence and self-esteem?
 
 Negative experiences can lower your confidence and self-esteem, like going through a breakup or being teased about your appearance. And positive experiences can boost your confidence and self-esteem, like doing well on a test, getting a compliment on how you look, or doing something nice for a friend or neighbour.
 
 What affects your confidence and self-esteem can be different for different people. These experiences might affect our confidence or self-esteem positively or negatively:
 
 * your results at school or college
 
 * social media or adverts
 
 * the level of support you receive from people you trust
 
 * your body image and how you feel about your appearance
 
 * your achievements or skills.
 
 But other experiences may only negatively affect our confidence and self-esteem, like:
 
 * physical or mental health problems that affect our ability to do certain things or be understood by others
 
 * peer pressure to fit in
 
 * pressure to achieve in exams, sport or other hobbies
 
 * being bullied or abused
 
 * experiencing stigma or discrimination
 
 * moving away from where we feel safe, like away from family or friends
 
 * family problems
 
 * relationship problems.
 
 You may be affected by other experiences that aren't in these lists. Or you might have had low confidence or self-esteem for a long time, which can make it hard to understand why you're feeling this way.
 
 ""Seeing other people choose to spend time with me helped me to realise that there are lots of things I like about myself, and to worry less about what they thought about me.""
 
 Changes to your confidence and self-esteem
 
 You may feel like your confidence or self-esteem changes from day to day, or that there's been a more noticeable change over time.
 
 If your confidence or self-esteem have been low for a long period of time, you should talk to your doctor. They will be able to see if your low confidence or self-esteem is linked to a mental health problem, like depression or anxiety. They will also be able to talk you through some different support options, like counselling, to see what's right for you.
 
 How can I build my confidence and self-esteem?
 
 Building your confidence and self-esteem can take time and practice. And what helps you now may not be the same thing as what helps in the future. But there's lots of things you can do to improve the way you feel about yourself and your abilities.
 
 It might feel like a big step to make changes. Start by trying a couple of new things each week, until you find what works for you. Go at your own pace and don't put too much pressure on yourself - small changes can make a big difference.

 'I have to present in front of my class, what can I do?'
 
 Here are some tips to help you prepare:
 
 * practice in front of your mirror, and then in front of your family, a friend, or your pet
 
 * act confident, even if you don't feel it
 
 * be honest with how you think you're doing
 
 * try not to compare yourself to others, or think about what they think of you
 
 * see it as a way of learning, not a chance of failing
 
 * remember that it's normal to feel nervous
 
 * enjoy yourself in the moment, and celebrate afterwards!

 Where can I go for help and support?
 
 If you're worried about how you're feeling, or your low confidence or self-esteem is affecting your relationships and everyday life, it's okay to ask for help. You could:
 
 * read our information on understanding your feelings, or visit our page on finding support for advice on what help is available
 
 * try talking to a trusted adult you know, or contact Childline or The Mix for a confidential chat with a counsellor
 
 * if you've been feeling like this for a while, you could talk to your doctor.

 Emily's tips
 
 Emily from Mind's Policy and Campaigns team shares some tips on how you can support a friend with their mental health.
 
 Looking after yourself
 
 Supporting a friend who's going through a difficult time can be hard and you might not notice how much it affects you. It's okay to feel upset, shocked, or angry from how they're acting.
 
 It's really important to make sure you look after yourself, so that you stay well and you're still able to help your friend. You could:
 
 * Try not to take on too much - supporting someone on your own can be a big responsibility. Try to encourage them to reach out to other people they trust too, like their family, teachers or other adults they are close to.
 
 * Set boundaries - like letting them know what support they can expect from you, so you can draw a line at how much you can do for your friends and when.
 
 * Think about how it affects you - if supporting your friend becomes overwhelming, or starts affecting your mood, sleep, or eating, it's important to let them know you have to take some time for yourself.
 
 * Look after your wellbeing - remember to take time for yourself and do things that help you relax. See our information on looking after your wellbeing for tips on things you can try.
 
 * Talk about your own feelings with someone you trust - if you want to talk things over confidentially, Childline and The Mix both have counsellors you can speak to.
 
 ""Though you want to help them it's harder when you are not feeling well yourself.""
 
 Signs someone might be struggling
 
 Sometimes it's hard to know if someone's struggling with their mental health, because everyone can act differently when they're going through a tough time.
 
 Some of the ways people might act differently are:
 
 * seeming distant, or not themselves
 
 * not meeting up or responding to messages as much as normal
 
 * spending more time on their own
 
 * not chatting, smiling or laughing as much
 
 * showing lower self-esteem
 
 * talking about feelings that worry you, or saying 'I can't do it any more'
 
 * not doing things they normally like
 
 * crying or shouting
 
 * smoking, drinking, or using drugs when they didn't before.
 
 Some of the physical changes you might notice in people are:
 
 * not dressing like they used to
 
 * gaining or losing weight
 
 * eating too much or too little
 
 * can't concentrate
 
 * looking tired
 
 * not washing or taking care of themselves
 
 * hurting themselves on purpose.
 
 How can I ask if they're ok?
 
 Finding the words to start talking to your friend about how they're feeling can be difficult. But really, there's no wrong way to begin and however you do it, they'll probably just appreciate you're trying. Here are some examples of conversation starters to get an idea:
 
 * 'Hey, I'm here for you if you want to talk.'
 
 * 'You're my mate, I'm here for you whenever.'
 
 * 'You've not seemed like yourself lately. How are you?'
 
 * 'We missed you at school today. Is everything okay?'
 
 * 'I'm worried about you. Is there anything you want to talk about?'
 
 * 'We haven't talked in a while. What's been happening?'
 
 If your friend doesn't want to talk, try not to pressure them. They will open up to you, or someone else they trust, when they're ready.
 
 ""What I didn't realise at the time was how much of a difference it makes to just say I care and I am here for you.""
 
 Tips on supporting a friend
 
 Knowing how to help a friend who's going through a difficult time can be hard. You might not know what to do, or worry that you're not doing enough, but you're most likely doing what you can. Here are some things you could try:
 
 * Find a time to talk - it can help to find somewhere quiet where you're not going to be interrupted or overheard by others. You can check out our conversation starters for some ideas on how to start the conversation.
 
 * Listen to them - just listening can make a huge difference to how someone feels. If they're finding it difficult to talk, let them know you're there when they're ready.
 
 * Comfort them - there isn't a wrong thing to say. But you could try 'you won't always feel like this' or 'you're not alone in this - there's lot of people who care about you'.
 
 * Ask them what would help - it could just be being there for them, or they might want help talking to an adult or looking for support options.
 
 * Encourage them to find support - like talking to a trusted adult like a parent, teacher, doctor or someone else they trust. You could even offer to go with them to talk to them. For more ideas on where to find support, see our page on finding support.
 
 * Do the things you both enjoy together - sometimes just doing the normal things you do together like watching a film or going for a walk can make a big difference to how they're feeling.
 
 * Keep in contact - ask them how they're doing, keep inviting them to join in, and keep sending the occasional message just to check in, even if they don't reply.
 
 * Do something nice - like just sending a message to make them smile or laugh, or planning something small for them to look forward to, like a sleepover or a trip to the cinema.
 
 * Be patient - your friendship might feel different for a while, but there will still be good times and they will be glad if you can stick by them.
 
 If your friend has opened up and it actually feels too much for you to handle, that's okay. You can thank them for talking to you, but explain how you're feeling. If you're able to, offer to help them find more support on our site. And don't forget to look after yourself too.
 
 ""Seeing someone that you care about going through something difficult can be very hard. But remember this won't last forever.""
 
 What if I'm worried about someone online?
 
 If a friend is acting differently online and it worries you, it's nice to want to support them - but you're not responsible for their safety. You can:
 
 * tell a trusted adult
 
 * if it's on social media, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube, you can report the situation on the site
 
 * if you think someone might hurt themselves or could be in any other form of immediate danger, call 999 (or ask an adult to).
 
 What if I've been asked to keep a secret?
 
 If a friend tells you something and asks you to keep it a secret, it's normal to not want to break their trust, or worry they might fall out with you if you tell someone.
 
 But if you don't feel comfortable with what they've told you, or you think they, or someone else could be in danger, you could:
 
 * ask them to tell an adult they trust themselves
 
 * tell them that you need to tell someone because you are worried about them, but you can ask if there is someone they would prefer you to talk to.
 
 Although it might feel like you're breaking their trust, it's important to tell a trusted adult about what your friend has said, to make sure you're both safe.
 
 What if they won't let me help?
 
 If your friend won't accept help from you or the people around them, it can be upsetting, annoying and can make you feel powerless. But try and remember there's only so much you can do, like:
 
 * give them time - they might not be ready to open up to you right now and might find it easier when they've had more time
 
 * let them know you're there for them if they ever want to talk, or just hang out
 
 * send them information on finding support, to read when they're ready.
 
 ""Whenever someone you care about is going through a tough time, it's perfectly natural to feel like you want to find a solution or fix something.""
 
 What if I'm worried about their safety?
 
 If you're worried that your friend is in any form of danger, or they might hurt themselves or someone else, it's important not to deal with it on your own:
 
 * tell a trusted adult as soon as you can, like a parent or teacher. If you feel comfortable, you can tell your friend you're going to do this so they expect it. They may not like it, or ask you not to, but their safety is important
 
 * if it's an emergency, ask an adult to call 999 or to take them to the hospital.
 
 Worrying about their safety can be exhausting, so it's good to look after yourself as well. See our page on looking after yourself for some ideas.

 What can I do if I'm worried about my health?
 
 It's normal to feel worried, sad, scared, angry, or annoyed about coronavirus, or to feel several emotions at once.
 
 But there are lots of things you can do to look after your physical and mental health that may help you to feel better:
 
 Follow advice from the experts
 
 Follow advice from the NHS and Public Health Wales. This includes information about staying at home, washing your hands, wearing a mask. Plus other things you can do to limit the spread of the virus.
 
 Be kind to yourself, too - if their advice makes you feel more worried, or you find it difficult to follow, talk to someone you trust like your parent, carer or a doctor.
 
 Get updates from trusted sources
 
 You could visit the BBC or the NHS. If you see or hear updates from individual people, like on social media, they may not be correct.
 
 Take breaks from social media and the news
 
 It can be overwhelming to be constantly reminded of coronavirus.
 
 By only checking for updates at times you set, you'll limit how much you take in, and give yourself space to think and relax.
 
 YoungMinds have more information on social media and mental health.
 
 Talk to someone about how you feel
 
 Especially if you're feeling worried a lot of the time. You could open up to a friend, or talk to a trusted adult like your parent or carer.
 
 If you'd rather talk to someone you don't know, you could call Childline using their confidential service.
 
 Remember, it's okay to ask for help. Even if you're not sure what's wrong, you always deserve support.
 
 Make a plan for what you'll do if you need to self-isolate
 
 Make a plan for how you'll spend your time at home. You can think about things to do, things to study, things that can make you feel better, and people to contact online.
 
 You could also discuss with a trusted adult how they can help you, such as reminding you of your plan and checking in on you regularly.
 
 Making a plan may also help you feel less worried about self-isolation.
 
 Look after your body
 
 Sleep is very important, especially if you have been feeling worried. And eating and drinking enough will help you keep your energy up and stay hydrated.
 
 These things will help you look after your mental wellbeing, as well as your physical health.
 
 ""It's hard when images on social media circulate reminding us to be productive all the time, eat perfectly, exercise every day, maintain every friendship and pick up new hobbies.""
 
 I'm being bullied because of my ethnicity
 
 You may have heard public figures calling the virus racist names, seen some people avoid others in the street or in shops, or been bullied yourself in person or online. 
 
 But no ethnicity or group of people is to blame for coronavirus. If you or someone you know is being bullied or abused because of it, that's known as a hate crime. The best thing you can do is tell a trusted adult about what's happening.
 
 Childline has more information about racism and racial bullying, and a confidential helpline if you want to talk about anything.
 
 If you, or your parent or carer decide to report it as a crime, or you would like more information or advice, Victim Support has a support line for young people that you can ring for free.
 
 Do I need to wear a mask?
 
 To help stop the spread of coronavirus, we're being asked to wear face masks or coverings in some public places, like on public transport.
 
 If you live in England, you may also be asked to wear a mask indoors at school or college in areas where it's hard to socially distance, like corridors or some classrooms.  
 
 The rules on where and when you need to wear a mask are slightly different in England and Wales.
 
 ? The UK Government has guidance explaining the latest rules for masks across England and other parts of the UK.
 
 ? The Welsh Government has guidance explaining the latest rules for masks in Wales.
 
 Anyone over 11 years old should wear a mask, unless they have a 'reasonable excuse' not to, like: 
 
 * if you're not able to put on, wear or take off a mask, because of an illness or disability 
 
 * if you need to eat, drink or take medicine
 
 * if putting on, wearing or taking off a face mask will cause you a lot of anxiety or distress (this only applies in England).
 
 If you think any of these reasonable excuses apply to you, speak to a family member or your doctor and they can support you to explore different options.
 
 Remember that it's important to be kind to yourself, and also to other people. Try not to judge anyone who isn't wearing a mask, and focus on what you can do to keep yourself safe and well.
 
 Tips for taking care of your mental wellbeing
 
 Many of us have struggled with our mental health during the pandemic. And now the rules are changing again, things might feel difficult.
 
 But there are things you can try to help yourself cope, and to boost your wellbeing:
 
 Look after your wellbeing
 
 This doesn't just include sleeping, and what you eat and drink, but also being active, creative, and kind to others - and yourself.
 
 If something helps you feel good, make time to do it. This could be something like drawing or baking, or listening to music.
 
 These things all affect how we think about ourselves, other people, and things that happen around us. You can read more about this on our page on looking after your wellbeing.
 
 ""Try to stick to a routine and good sleep pattern. Keep in touch with friends and avoid talking to people who stress you out.""
 
 Stay active indoors
 
 If you're spending lots of time at home, there are plenty of ways to be active. For example:
 
 ? tidying your room
 
 ? helping to clean your home
 
 ? dancing to music 
 
 ? going up and down the stairs 
 
 ? seated exercises
 
 ? doing online workouts or yoga - you could try streaming a free workout or yoga session on YouTube. 
 
 For more ideas on activities you can do indoors or in your garden, visit the Scouts, Girlguiding and National Trust websites.
 
 Find new ways to spend time inside
 
 Being creative or taking time to relax may help you accept what is happening. 
 
 You could try: 
 
 ? painting or drawing 
 
 ? writing down your thoughts or creating a short story 
 
 ? exercise videos online, like yoga or dance 
 
 ? playing music 
 
 ? playing a video or computer game 
 
 ? making something out of scrap material or wood. 
 
 Keep in touch with people
 
 Message, call or video-call those you can't meet up with. It will help you feel connected, and give a sense of things continuing as usual.
 
 You could also send someone a card or a small gift to let them know you're thinking of them. 
 
 Remember, if you're friends or family start talking about the coronavirus too much, or you have different views, you can ask them to change the subject.
 
 Benefit from online groups
 
 You may be able to stream a film-watching party with some friends, or find an online singing group you can join.
 
 Just be careful about who you're connecting with, and don't join any private groups or chats without your parent or carer's permission. For advice on how to stay safe online, visit Childline's website.
 
 Practice self-care
 
 Self-care can help you manage your thoughts and feelings, and may help to improve your mental health.

 Tips on how to cope with being at home with others
 
 As we are all spending so much time at home, there's bound to be a bit of friction at times.
 
 Here are some tips that might help:
 
 Give each other space
 
 Try to respect everyone's privacy - not everyone may want to talk about something, or hang out at the same time.
 
 Get creative
 
 Do something you wouldn't normally have time for - play games, watch something together, or give a room a mini-makeover.
 
 Open up
 
 Start the conversation about how you're feeling, if you feel able to - we have information on opening up to others to support you.
 
 Ask them how they're feeling
 
 Your parent, carer or sibling might be feeling a mixture of emotions now, too.
 
 If you're able to, they may really appreciate you supporting them as well. This could be anything from giving them a hug, to doing something extra around the house, or helping with school work.
 
 If home isn't safe:
 
 If you're worried about staying at home with someone because it isn't safe for you, whether you're with a partner, family member or friend, the most important thing you can do is keep yourself safe.
 
 Childline and the Hideout have advice on domestic abuse, and Refuge has a free helpline you can ring for support.
 
 How can I cope with changes to school or college?
 
 Now schools and colleges are starting to open again, you might feel lots of mixed emotions about what the next few months hold.? 
 
 Here's some information which might help:? 
 
 If you're at?school or college?
 
 Secondary schools, sixth forms and colleges are opening again, but you may notice some things are still different. 
 
 There may be different ways of getting around campus,?smaller class sizes, and more checkpoints to use hand sanitiser or wash your?hands.?
 
 You may also be asked to wear a mask in areas where there's lots of students.?Your teachers will be able to explain more to you. 
 
 If you're nervous or worried,?you can talk to your parent or carer, or a teacher, about how you're feeling. Remember to?be kind to yourself, it will feel weird for a while.
 
 ""One thing to remind ourselves is that what's happening is beyond our control right now.""? 
 
 If you're sent home to isolate
 
 Your school or college will let you know ways you can continue learning at home, such as sending you work by email or post, providing virtual lessons, and finding ways to provide support from teachers. 
 
 Your parents or carers may also be sent information to help you study, or want to help teach you. If you're worried about any of this, you can talk to your school or college.?
 
 If you're worried about exams not going ahead?
 
 Your teachers will be looking at your mock exams and coursework, and working together to create a 'predicted grade'? they think will be an honest representation of what you would achieve.? 
 
 If you aren't happy with your grade,?you might be able to sit your exams in the autumn, or?sit them next summer (2022).?? 
 
 The government wants you to be able to move on to whatever you want the next stage of your life to be in autumn, whether that's further education, apprenticeships, or higher education. This means they'll be supporting you to do this as much as they can, by changing some of the normal rules.? 
 
 You can talk to your teacher if you're still worried or have other questions.? 
 
 If you're a carer at home
 
 If you've been caring for someone during the pandemic, going back to school or college may feel like a stressful or scary time.
 
 You may be worried about being able to keep up with your studies, or?about how to keep them safe at home.? 
 
 The best thing you can do is talk to your teacher and let them know what's going on for you and how they can support you.
 
 Action for Carers also has a guide on how to make an emergency plan, which you could share with your teachers or loved ones.?
 
 What's happening with my treatment or support?
 
 With everything going on, you may be finding it harder to access medication, treatment or support.
 
 It's still possible to talk to professionals about your health, such as doctors, care workers, and pharmacists. They may have just changed how they'd like you to contact them. For example, your doctor might want to phone you rather than see you at the surgery. 
 
 You may also be put on a waiting list or given an appointment that feels far away in the future. If this happens, you can ring the service to see if a closer appointment has become available, or talk to your doctor.
 
 Remember: it's always ok to ask for help for your mental health.
 
 You are not wasting anyone's time, whether you're having ongoing treatment or seeking support for the first time.
 
 If you take prescription medication
 
 You can look into ordering your repeat prescription online, by app, or over the phone - you may need an adult to help you with this. 
 
 If you have symptoms of coronavirus, you should also ask someone to pick up your prescription for you, or ask your pharmacy about home delivery.
 
 If you have therapy, treatment, or other support from mental health services
 
 Changes may be made, or have already been made, to your treatment or care plan because of lockdown.  
 
 You can speak to someone in your mental health team to find out how your support can carry on. Or to see if changes need to be made. They can also support you if a new referral is taking a long time to be processed. 
 
 If you're having counselling in your school or college, they should tell you what to do over lockdown if you need someone to talk to. 
 
 If you need treatment or support for the first time
 
 If you have been struggling with how you're feeling for some time, and think you need some support to help you cope, talking to your doctor is a good place to start.
 
 If you don't want to talk to your doctor, or you're unsure about what other support is out there for you, you can find more information on our finding support page.
 
 ""I would urge anyone who is struggling with their mental health during the pandemic to reach out and seek help.""

 Tips on supporting others
 
 It's normal to feel sad or guilty about distancing yourself from someone you love or care about.
 
 But remember that it's not forever, and it's about protecting and looking after them, even from a distance.
 
 If you're worried about friends or family:
 
 Keep in touch regularly
 
 Sending them texts and pictures, and agreeing a regular time to talk to each other on the phone, will help them feel they're supported and are being thought of. You could also video call them, if that's available to you both.
 
 Ask them how they're feeling
 
 Let them know that you're there if they want to talk. You can also share this web page with them, or our guide for adults.
 
 Encourage them to stay active
 
 You could encourage them to tidy up around the house, or do some gentle exercises indoors or outside if this is possible.
 
 Ask them about work or school
 
 You may be worried about a family member who is working in unsafe conditions. 
 
 You can show your support for them by checking in, asking how work is and how they're coping. You could also share our information on coping as key worker with them.
 
 You may also be worried about a sibling or friend who is finding school difficult at the minute. You can show your support by checking in on them and giving them space to talk about their feelings.
 
 Show you appreciate them
 
 Send them a message, or say thank you to them on social media through our #SpeakYourMind challenge on TikTok.
 
 Talk to someone you trust if you're worried about someone else
 
 They may understand, or even feel the same, and be able to support you.
 
 Where else can I get support?
 
 During this time, you may find you need more support, or want to connect with people who you identify with.
 
 We have information on finding support and talking to a doctor which you might find helpful.

 Information for young people who are struggling with their feelings about lockdown changing, and want to know how to cope.
 
 This page is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
 
 Managing your feelings about changes to lockdown
 
 The coronavirus pandemic has been hard for lots of us. And lockdown and government restrictions mean that there's still a lot we can't do, that we're missing out on, and that we're still worried about. 
 
 Lots of change and uncertainty can feel really stressful. 
 
 We're here to help you understand your feelings, and give you some positive ways to cope.
 
 This page covers:
 
 ? Feelings about lockdown changing
 
 ? What are positive and negative coping strategies?
 
 ? What could help me cope and adjust?
 
 ? How can I support a friend or family member?
 
 ? Where else can I get support?
 
 To find out what the rules are right now, see the UK Government coronavirus guidance, in English, or the Welsh Government?coronavirus guidance, in English and Welsh.
 
 ""The rules aren't clear and are constantly changing and I'm scared I won't adjust quick enough.""
 
 Feelings about lockdown changing
 
 Everyone will be feeling different about lockdown and changing government restrictions.
 
 You may feel relieved when you hear about the rules changing where you live, or you may feel worried or angry. You may not know how you feel, or feel a mixture of emotions.
 
 For example:
 
 Low or sad
 
 ? You might be feeling sad about how things are right now. For example, if you're missing out on everyday social things, like school, parties and sport. Or exciting plans, like travelling or work experience.
 
 ? You might be feeling isolated or low because you're not able to see family and friends. 
 
 ? You may also feel low or lacking in purpose because you've been furloughed or have lost your job because of the virus.
 
 Fed up or worn down
 
 ? You may be feeling worn down after months of living through the pandemic. Especially if you're not getting on with your family or the people you live with.
 
 ? Or you may have been hiding parts of your identity from the people you live with, like your sexuality or faith, and want to be yourself again.
 
 ? You may also be feeling fed up because of changes to the rules and the compromises you're having to make.
 
 ? Or you may feel frustrated if you think that the government are handling things the wrong way.
 
 Angry or wound up
 
 ? You may feel angry that other people aren't following social distancing rules.
 
 ? Perhaps you're feeling pressure from friends to meet up and feel confused about what's allowed.
 
 ? Maybe you don't feel like you're getting enough support with school or college work. Or you may feel angry that your exam grades will be decided by your teachers.
 
 Worried, anxious or scared
 
 ? You may be scared or upset because someone you care about has to go to work where they feel unsafe. 
 
 ? You may have existing difficulties around coping with germs or hygiene, which coronavirus and social distancing is making worse.
 
 ? You may feel worried about how coronavirus will affect your education, career or other parts of your future. For example, you might be feeling sad that you've missed a lot of time in school. Or you might feel that college or university isn't what you hoped for, or that you're missing out on things. 
 
 ? You may be worried about going back to school or college, or needing to take coronavirus tests regularly to do so. Or about the lockdown restrictions being relaxed in general. 
 
 ? You might also feel anxious that your relationships have changed during lockdown, like with your friends, girlfriend or boyfriend.
 
 Like you've been hard done-by
 
 ? You may be feeling annoyed because the government guidance for young people isn't clear. Or feeling powerless, like you don't have a say in what's going on.
 
 ? Or you might feel annoyed that young people and students are being blamed unfairly for rises in coronavirus cases. 
 
 ? You may be feeling cheated because your grades won't be based on exams this year, or feel like you've missed out on important time with teachers.
 
 ? Or you may feel hard done-by that you don't have equipment like a laptop available when your classmates do.  
 
 ? Maybe your mental health support has had to change during lockdown. Or you're frustrated because lockdown has caused you to take steps back in your recovery.
 
 ? Or your family might be going through difficult money issues, and you may feel pressure to provide support, or fear that you'll lose your independence.
 
 Like you've been through something traumatic
 
 ? You may have gone through something very stressful, frightening or upsetting this past year. For example, if you've had to stay somewhere that wasn't a safe place for you.
 
 ? Or you may be recovering from coronavirus or helping a family member to get better.
 
 ? Someone you love may have died this year, and you might be grieving and also feeling afraid to lose anyone else.
 
 Hopeful for the future
 
 ? You may be feeling positive about the people you love getting their vaccinations.
 
 ? Or you may be excited to see your friends in school or college. Or feel safer there if everyone is taking regular coronavirus tests.
 
 ? You may feel happy about plans to relax lockdown restrictions, especially if you're already making plans to see friends or family members you haven't seen in a long time.
 
 ? Or you may feel hopeful about getting back to normal, and being able to do things like play team sports, go to a gig, or go on holiday.
 
 These are only a few examples of what you may be feeling right now. You may be experiencing several of these feelings, or be going through something completely different.

 What are positive and negative coping strategies?
 
 Coping is our ability to respond to, and deal with, unpleasant, difficult or stressful situations. Our ability to cope with things can vary - we can cope well one day, and poorly the next.
 
 Coping strategies are things we choose to do in unpleasant situations, to manage our emotions and help us get through them, or to lessen how it will affect us. There are both positive and negative coping strategies.
 
 Positive coping strategies are healthy ways of coping that are good for our wellbeing in the long term. You can find some ideas and examples of positive coping strategies in the tips for coping and adjusting section below.
 
 Negative coping strategies are unhealthy ways of coping that can harm our wellbeing or cause other problems. They may feel impulsive or urge-driven. We also may not realise at the time that we're using negative strategies to escape from something.
 
 The negative coping strategies young people have told us they're using during the coronavirus pandemic include:
 
 * Eating too much, or not enough
 
 * Drinking alcohol or using illegal drugs
 
 * Legal highs
 
 * Smoking cigarettes or vaping
 
 * Self-harming.
 
 To get support from organisations who can help, go to our coronavirus useful contacts page for young people.
 
 What could help me cope and adjust?
 
 You may be facing lots of challenges now lockdown rules are changing, and some of the feelings you're having may be hard to cope with.
 
 While things remain uncertain, we can focus on what we can control and take positive steps to look after our wellbeing.
 
 We asked young people to tell us what they've been doing to help themselves cope during the pandemic. You might find it useful to try some of the positive coping strategies they suggested.
 
 Here are some ideas:
 
 Understand your feelings
 
 There are things you can do to help you understand and accept how you're feeling, like:
 
 ? Use an emotions wheel to help name feelings that are hard to pinpoint.
 
 ? Talk to someone you trust about what 'normal' looks like for you right now, to help you accept what is happening. This could be a parent or carer, a friend, or a helpline such as Childline.
 
 ? Write, draw, run, or do something else that will give you space to feel everything you're currently feeling. Even the really unhappy, angry stuff.
 
 ? Recognise and challenge unkind or unhelpful thoughts. Try to do this by talking to yourself as you would to a good friend. You could ask yourself: 'How might someone else see this?', 'Is there anything that suggests this might not happen?', or 'What would I say to a friend who was thinking this?' Answering these questions may help you to think more rationally and calmly.
 
 ? Visit our page on understanding my feelings if you're still struggling to understand how you're feeling.
 
 Build relationships
 
 Spending time with friends and family, whether in person or not, can help us feel better and boost our wellbeing. You could:
 
 ? Invest time in the relationships you want to grow and build - those which you rely on for support as well as fun.
 
 ? Keep in touch with friends, family, boyfriends and girlfriends by sending them a card, a letter or a small gift.
 
 ? Share how you feel with someone you trust - this can help strengthen your friendship as well as giving you both a chance to support each other.
 
 ? Wear a mask in a design that you like, or design your own, to help you feel more comfortable when you meet your friends.
 
 ? Choose an activity that you can play outside whilst distancing, like football, catch, or cycling. This could help you feel connected while been physically spaced out, so that social distancing doesn't feel as weird.
 
 ? Connect with others who understand - for example, you could try The Mix's community message boards.
 
 ""Find other people your age you can talk to. It really helps because we're going through the same thing.""
 
 Coping in difficult moments
 
 When things get tough, there are quick things you can try to reduce worry and panic, like:
 
 ? A 'grounding' activity to stop your thoughts spinning out of control. Sit back and focus on what's going on around you. Try and name five things you can see, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
 
 ? Find a distraction that takes your mind off things, like going for a walk, listening to happy music or talking to someone. These can help you when you notice you're worrying about the past or future.
 
 ? Find a mindfulness activity to help you stay in the moment. You could try this breathing exercise - breathe in through your nose for four counts, hold it for two counts, and breathe out through your mouth for seven counts. If you repeat this, it can slow your breath and help keep you calm.
 
 ? Ask for support from someone you trust, whether it's a friend, family member, or helpline like Childline or The Mix.
 
 ? Find more information on anxiety and tips on how to cope on YoungMinds website.
 
 ""Keep yourself busy, doing things you love and things that makes you proud of yourself for finishing.""
 
 Plan and control what you can
 
 Taking small steps to recognise what's in your control right now, and what you can do to plan ahead, can help you feel more settled:
 
 ? Make a timetable of your day or week, making sure you include fun or relaxing activities. This can help you plan ahead, and feel in more control of your near future.
 
 ? Write down your worries before bed and go over them in the morning. This can help you work out what no longer needs your attention, what things you can do to make yourself feel better, and what is out of your control.
 
 ? Be involved in making decisions about how you're keeping safe, like asking to choose the hand soap or shower gel you use, or picking your own face mask.
 
 ""I've realised I'm more capable of making my own decisions without pressure from my school.""
 
 Keep yourself well
 
 Looking after your physical wellbeing can have a big impact on your mental health, too.
 
 There are simple things you can try to look after your physical health, like:
 
 ? Have a good bedtime and sleep routine. For example, have time away from a screen before you go to bed and limit the amount of caffeine you drink.
 
 ? Eat healthily and stay active - this will look after both your body and mind and help your thoughts to become clearer.
 
 ? Make sure you still follow guidance from the government and NHS on washing your hands, wearing a mask and social distancing.
 
 ? Be kind to yourself if you forget to do something, or you make a mistake. This is new for everyone and all we can do is try our best.
 
 ""Take care of your basic needs - try to eat and drink regularly, brush teeth, have a shower.""
 
 How can I support a friend or family member?
 
 If someone you care about is going through a tough time, it's natural to want to support them. But with everything going on, you may feel like you don't know how to help.
 
 Here's some tips on supporting someone from a distance:
 
 * Remember that everyone is experiencing something different right now - what might be easy for one person may be really hard for someone else.
 
 * Ask them what you could do to help, if you feel able to.
 
 * Offer them a time to talk if you think they need to hear a friendly voice.
 
 * Keep in contact. If they're not up to chatting, let them know that's okay, but try to stay in touch in different ways. For example, you could share a drawing or some art with them, or post or email them things that will make them smile.
 
 * Say thank you to them on social media through our #SpeakYourMind challenge on TikTok, and say why you appreciate them.
 
 ""Reminding them you're there if they need you and properly listening when they choose to open up, while continuing with your normal lives, is the best balance possible.""
 
 Where else can I get support?
 
 During this time, you may find you need more support, or want to connect with people who you identify with.
 
 We have information on finding support and talking to a doctor which you might find helpful.

75,1,"How do I know if I have a mental health condition?
 
 Understanding what is considered ""normal"" mental health can be difficult. For example, when does nervousness become a phobia? When does ""just feeling sad"" become depression, which is a serious condition? A mental health professional can help you figure out whether you have a mental health condition. If you do, treatment can help you feel better. People can and do recover from mental health conditions.
 
 How can I tell if I have a mental health condition?
 
 If you're experiencing a change in your thoughts, behaviors, or moods that is interfering with your work or relationships for longer than 2 weeks, you may have a mental health condition. It can be difficult to tell whether you have a mental health condition if you feel sadness, anxiety, or other intense emotions most of the time. Many mental health conditions first appear early in life, usually before 25 years old.
 
 Symptoms of a mental health condition can include extreme anxiety most of the time, feelings of hopelessness about everything, or drug or alcohol abuse.
 
 If you are in any doubt about your mental health, reach out to your doctor or nurse, a mental health professional, or a trusted loved one for help. If you have health insurance, this type of health care might be called ""behavioral health"" by your insurance plan. Many insurance plans call problems with drug or alcohol misuse ""substance abuse"" services.
 
 Are mental health conditions really medical problems?
 
 Yes. Mental health conditions are medical problems and can have just as big an effect on your life as physical problems. Researchers know that the brains of people with mental health conditions often work differently from others. Some mental health conditions are related to higher or lower levels of certain brain chemicals. Events such as violence, abuse, and other traumatic experiences can make mental health conditions worse or more difficult to manage.
 
 Many people with mental health conditions may be embarrassed to talk to a counselor or doctor or nurse about mental health or may think it's a sign of weakness. But mental health conditions are health problems just like physical illnesses, and getting help when you need it is actually a sign of strength. If you are concerned about your mental health, do not hesitate to talk to someone or get help.
 
 What are the symptoms of a mental health condition?
 
 Talk to a mental health professional if you are experiencing:
 
 ? A lack of interest in things that you used to enjoy
 
 ? Crying spells
 
 ? Lack of motivation
 
 ? Inability to concentrate
 
 ? Significant changes in your eating or sleeping patterns
 
 ? An inability to cope with problems or daily activities
 
 ? More anxiety than usual over events or situations
 
 ? Feelings of hopelessness
 
 ? Sudden changes in your personality for no reason
 
 ? An inability to stop thinking about certain ideas or memories
 
 ? Sadness for longer than 2 weeks
 
 ? Thoughts about suicide (call 911 if you are in immediate danger)
 
 ? Drug or alcohol abuse or illegal use of prescription drugs
 
 ? Extreme mood swings
 
 ? Violent behavior or a lot of anger or hostility
 
 ? Hearing voices or seeing things that other people don't hear or see
 
 How are mental health conditions diagnosed?
 
 There is no one test for mental health conditions. Your doctor, nurse, or a mental health professional may ask you about your symptoms and experiences and how long you've had them and talk with you about ways to deal with them.
 
 How are mental health conditions treated?
 
 Treatment for a mental health condition depends on the specific condition and how severe it is. Your doctor, nurse, or therapist may give you medicine, or your doctor or nurse may refer you for therapy, or do both. In very rare but serious cases when your life is in danger, such as a suicide attempt, you may need to stay at a hospital or other treatment facility.
 
 There are also different types of therapy for different types of mental health conditions. For example, phobias (fears of specific things or situations that make a person avoid everyday activities) are treated differently from depression. Certain types of therapy can teach you skills to retrain how you think or act.
 
 Other types of support that can help include building life skills (such as how to find a job or a place to live), learning how to manage your thoughts, eating healthy and exercising, finding a new community (such as a place of worship or a hobby group), and joining support groups.
 
 Does mental health treatment work?
 
 Yes, people can get better with treatment and other types of support. Different types of supports and treatments might work for different people. Try different types of treatment and support until you find what works for you. You may need to try different approaches at different times in life.
 
 How can I help make my treatment work?
 
 If you have been diagnosed with a mental health condition, it's important that you follow the advice of your mental health professional. You may need more than one treatment or a different treatment if your symptoms do not get better.
 
 * Take your medicines as directed. Some medicines take time to work. Medicines may also have side effects. Work with your doctor or nurse to find the medicine that works best for you. Some people stop taking the medicine once they start feeling better, but this can be risky. Stopping a medicine very suddenly may cause serious side effects, including thoughts of suicide. Try not to stop taking medicine without talking to your doctor or nurse first. If you have concerns about your medicine, let your doctor or nurse know so you can work together to adjust the amount of medicine or find a different medicine.
 
 * Participate fully in therapy. Therapy, sometimes called ""talk therapy,"" works best when you attend sessions as scheduled, are honest with yourself and your therapist, and do any ""homework"" between sessions.
 
 * Reach out to friends and family or others for support. You are not alone. There are people who want to help you. If you are having thoughts about hurting yourself or someone else, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline(link is external) at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
 
 * Learn steps you can take to stay mentally healthy. Get enough sleep, make healthy eating choices, and get regular physical activity. Learn more steps you can take to support good mental health.
 
 Will the medicine I take make me gain weight?
 
 Maybe. Some medicines that doctors prescribe for mental health conditions can make women more likely to gain weight than other types of medicine. This may be due to how your body processes the medicine. It may also be because getting treatment for a mental health condition can improve your appetite if you weren't eating well before treatment.1
 
 The most common medicines linked to weight gain are a type of medicine called antipsychotics, often used to treat schizophrenia (a serious mental health condition). Some antidepressants and mood stabilizers, which can be used to treat depression and bipolar disorder, can also increase the chances of gaining weight.2
 
 All medicines have risks. Talk to your doctor or nurse about the benefits and risks of your medicines. If you're concerned about gaining weight from your medicine, talk to your doctor or nurse about whether a different medicine or treatment method may work better.
 
 How can I get help paying for mental health treatment?
 
 Most health insurance plans cover mental health treatment in the same ways they cover medical or surgical treatments. There is not a different copay, coinsurance, or deductible for mental health treatment.
 
 * If you have insurance, check with your insurance provider to find out what's included in your plan. If you have insurance through your employer, you may be able to get help through an employee assistance program (EAP). Through your EAP, you may be able to get short-term counseling for stress, mental health symptoms, and substance abuse.
 
 * If you have Medicaid, your plan will provide some mental health services. Some plans offer substance use disorder services.
 
 * If you have Medicare, your plan may help cover mental health services, including hospital stays, visits to a therapist, and medicines you may need.
 
 If you do not have insurance, use the mental health services locator on this page to find free or low-cost care on a sliding scale according to your income.

 ? Getting the right balance of nutrients, including enough fiber and water, can help your mood stay stable. Sugary, processed foods increase your blood sugar and then make you feel tired and irritable when your blood sugar levels drop.
 
 ? Some vitamins and minerals may help with the symptoms of depression. Experts are researching how a lack of some nutrients is linked to depression in new mothers. These include selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, folate, vitamin B12, calcium, iron, and zinc.2
 
 ? Drinking too much alcohol can lead to mental and physical health problems.
 
 ? Drinks with caffeine can make it harder for you to sleep, which can make some mental health conditions worse. Also, drinking caffeine regularly and then suddenly stopping can cause caffeine withdrawal, which can make you irritable and give you headaches.3 Don't have drinks with caffeine within 5 hours of going to sleep.
 
 Eating nutritious foods may not cure a mental health condition, but eating healthy is a good way to start feeling better. Ask your doctor or nurse for more information about the right foods to eat to help keep your mind and body healthy.

 How does physical activity affect my mental health?
 
 Physical activity can help your mental health in several ways:
 
 * Aerobic exercise can boost your mood. Your body makes certain chemicals, called endorphins, during and after your workout. Endorphins relieve stress and make you feel calmer.
 
 * Getting physical activity during the day can make it easier to sleep at night.4 Creating a routine can help you stay motivated and build a habit of getting regular physical activity.5
 
 * Physical activity may help with depression and anxiety symptoms.6 Studies show that regular aerobic exercise boosts your mood and lowers anxiety and depression.7
 
 * Physical activity may help slow or stop weight gain, which is a common side effect of some medicines used to treat mental health conditions.
 
 Regular physical activity can benefit your health over the long term. Getting active every day (at least 30 minutes a day of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, like brisk walking) helps maintain your health. All Americans should also do strengthening exercises at least 2 days a week to build and maintain muscles.8 Your doctor or nurse may recommend exercise in addition to taking medicine and getting counseling for mental health conditions.
 
 Learn more about how to be active for health.
 
 How does aging affect my mental health?
 
 As you age, your body and brain change. These changes can affect your physical and mental health. Older women may face more stressful living or financial situations than men do, because women live longer on average. They may also have spent more time staying home to raise children or care for loved ones instead of working outside of the home.
 
 In the years leading up to menopause (perimenopause), women may experience shifts in mood because of hormone changes. They may also experience hot flashes, problems sleeping, and other symptoms that can make it harder to deal with stress or other life changes.
 
 Learn more about how aging and menopause affect your mental health.
 
 How does my physical health affect my mental health?
 
 People who are not physically healthy may have trouble staying mentally healthy. People living with chronic (long-term) health problems such as diabetes and heart disease are often more likely to have higher stress levels, depression, and anxiety.9 Researchers are not sure which problems happen first, but many people have a chronic disease and a mental health condition. Having a chronic disease does not always mean you will have a mental health condition, but if you are struggling with both, know that you are not alone. Support groups and health care professionals can help. Healthy habits, like eating healthy and getting exercise, that help improve many chronic diseases may also help improve mental health conditions.
 
 How does smoking, drinking alcohol, or misusing drugs affect mental health?
 
 The chemicals in tobacco and alcohol can change the chemicals in your brain, making you more likely to feel depressed or anxious.10,11 People with mental health conditions are also more likely to smoke and drink alcohol.
 
 Using illegal drugs, or misusing prescription drugs, is also linked to mental health conditions. Researchers are not sure whether drugs can cause mental health conditions, whether mental health conditions cause addiction, or whether both are linked to another health problem. People who have experienced trauma, whether physical or emotional (or both), are more likely to misuse drugs and alcohol.
 
 * Get tips for women about quitting smoking at women.smokefree.gov.
 
 * Learn more about how alcohol and other substances are related to mental health conditions.
 
 How do traumatic or negative childhood events affect mental health?
 
 Two out of every 3 women have experienced at least one serious traumatic or negative event during childhood, increasing their risk of adult health problems, including mental health conditions.12
 
 * Traumatic events can include physical or sexual abuse, neglect, bullying, neighborhood violence, natural disasters, terrorism, and war. While many people in the United States experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, most don't suffer long-term problems as a result.
 
 * Negative events during childhood can include abuse (physical, emotional, verbal, or sexual), neglect, or a problem with an adult in the home, such as seeing domestic violence or having a caregiver go to prison. The more negative childhood events you have experienced, the higher your risk of a serious health problem as an adult. Learn more about negative (adverse) childhood events.
 
 Women are more likely than men to experience certain types of trauma, such as sexual abuse or assault, and are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition.
 
 What else can affect my mental health?
 
 Mental health conditions affect women of all races and ethnicities. But your environment - where and how you live - can have an effect on your mental health. Women who grew up in poverty or who live in poverty as adults and women in a sexual minority (such as women who identify as lesbian or bisexual) may be more likely to experience mental health conditions, such as depression.13
 
 * Some studies show that children who grow up in poverty can have a higher risk of developing certain mental health conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, as adults.14
 
 * Children who witness domestic violence (also called intimate partner violence) are more likely to develop mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, as adults. Learn more about the effects of domestic violence on children.15
 
 * Lesbians and bisexual women are at higher risk of mood and anxiety disorders than heterosexual women.16
 
 Do past or current difficulties in life mean I'll develop a mental health condition?
 
 No. Many people experience major stress in life, including poverty, unemployment, trauma, abuse, family difficulties, or chronic health problems. Experiencing these stressful situations does not mean you will definitely develop a mental health condition. But if you do experience serious, stressful situations and develop a mental health condition, know that it is not your fault. You can get help and treatment for mental health conditions.
 
 Learning ways to manage stress and reaching out for help when you need it can help you protect your mental health. Learn more about steps you can take to protect your mental health.

77,0,"Good mental health at every age
 
 Each stage of your life can create different challenges to good mental health. The events that worry you as a 20-year-old probably won't be the same as what causes you stress when you're 50. Eating right, staying physically active, getting enough sleep, and having healthy relationships will help support good physical and mental health throughout life. If you're worried about your mental health, talk to someone right away.
 
 What do I need to know about mental health in my teens and 20s?
 
 Researchers think that most mental health conditions begin early in life, usually by 25 years old.2 Mental health conditions are common in young people, but some conditions are more serious or last longer than others. A recent survey showed that almost 1 in 3 young women 18 to 25 said they had a mental health condition in the past year.3 One in about every 10 young women has a serious mental health condition that impacts daily activities such as working or going to school.4
 
 In your early 20s, you may be dealing with stressful life situations such as finding a job or finishing college, moving out of a family home, and becoming financially independent. This can be a stressful time for anyone. It can be more difficult to handle these life changes if you have a mental health condition. Also, if you have lived with a mental health condition for most of your life, it can be difficult to know that you have a health problem that can be treated.
 
 What you can do:
 
 ? Protect your mental health by knowing the signs of a mental health condition.
 
 ? Get help. If you feel hopeless or your thoughts or actions feel out of control, get help. You could have a mental health condition that can be treated with medicine or counseling.
 
 ? Talk to a mental health professional. Treatment works, and the earlier you get treatment, the better it works.
 
 ? Start building healthy habits now. Learn steps to support good mental health.
 
 What do I need to know about mental health in my 30s and 40s?
 
 In your 30s and 40s, you may be building a career, raising a family, or juggling many different responsibilities all at the same time. These changes can be exhausting and stressful and make it difficult to maintain good mental health. Your menstrual cycle or pregnancy can also affect your mental well-being, from mood swings during your period or pregnancy to problems getting pregnant. Learn more about reproductive health and mental health.
 
 Perimenopause, the transition to menopause, often begins in your late 40s. Perimenopause can cause sudden hormonal ups and downs that can affect your physical and mental health.
 
 What you can do:
 
 * Don't forget about your own health. During your annual health checkup, often called a ""well-woman visit,"" talk to your doctor or nurse about your mental health and well-being.
 
 * Follow your doctor's advice. If you've already been diagnosed with a mental health condition, follow your doctor's advice about any medicines and steps you can take at home to feel better.
 
 * Develop healthy habits. Eating right, exercising, getting enough sleep, and staying connected with others can make it easier to deal with many of the stresses of your 30s and 40s. Having healthy habits can make it easier to find the energy to get help for mental health conditions.
 
 What do I need to know about mental health in my 50s and 60s?
 
 In your early 50s, you will probably experience menopause, which can affect mental health or stress levels. If you are in a romantic relationship, you may find that expectations and roles have changed over the years. By your 60s, you may be facing retirement or dealing with a chronic illness. You may also find yourself suddenly in an emptier house if you have children who have moved out, or you might be a caretaker for an elderly parent. Such major life changes can have emotional and even physical effects.
 
 What you can do:
 
 * Treat menopause symptoms. Talk to your doctor about relief for menopause symptoms if they are uncomfortable or add stress to your life. Changing hormone levels during menopause and perimenopause can also affect your emotions. Learn more about how menopause affects your mental health.
 
 * Prioritize your own health. If you are a caregiver, try to be aware of your own stress levels and physical needs. You can also find help through a local support group, hospital services, or other community resources. Learn more about caregiver stress.
 
 * Stay active. If you are retired, keep your mind and body active. Retirement is an opportunity to spend time doing things you never had time for, such as learning a new skill or hobby, volunteering, or seeing friends and family more often. But being without a regular job and co-workers you see every day can also feel lonely.
 
 * Try something new. If you have ""empty nest syndrome"" - a phrase parents often use for the feelings of sadness or loneliness they experience when their children move out of the house - try something new. Volunteer, join a club, play a sport, or make a list of places to visit or things you've always wanted to do.
 
 * Stay in touch. Reach out to someone if you're having trouble coping with the physical or emotional effects of aging. Lean on friends or loved ones, or make time to talk to a mental health professional. You are not alone.
 
 What do I need to know about mental health after age 70?
 
 Your 70s and beyond can be a time of enjoying retirement, starting new hobbies, and seeing friends and family more often. It can also be the time when many people are diagnosed with serious health problems, such as heart disease or cancer. Sometimes, you're dealing with the death of a loved one. People in their 70s and beyond may also face tough financial situations due to medical bills or running out of retirement savings.
 
 Older adults who have serious physical conditions are more likely to develop depression.5 About 1 in 8 older women said they had a mental health condition in the past year.6 Adults over 65 also may have more trouble sleeping, which can make mental health conditions worse.
 
 Although these challenges can be stressful and upsetting, there are tools you can use to help achieve good mental health in your 70s and beyond.
 
 What you can do:
 
 * Maintain strong relationships. Older adults can be more isolated from their friends, family, and community. Having a strong social network of close family and friends can help your mental and even physical health.
 
 * Give something back. Research shows that volunteering your time and talents to benefit others can help you feel more connected and lower your stress levels.7
 
 * Eat well. Older women need just as many nutrients as younger women but may need fewer calories for energy. To get a personalized calorie recommendation, use the MyPlate Plan tool. Talk to your doctor about whether you might need to take supplements.
 
 * Be active. Physical activity can help your bones, heart, and mood. Ask your doctor about what activities are right for you. Most adults need to get at least 2 hours and 30 minutes a week of moderate aerobic physical activity or 1 hour and 15 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, or some combination of the two. Talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise program. Most adults also need 2 days of strengthening activities to keep bones and muscles healthy. Learn more about physical activity for older adults.
 
 * Use the resources in your community. As you get older, it can be difficult to face a loss of independence like driving or living in your own home. Learn about the free and low-cost resources in your community that can allow you to maintain independence in older age. The Administration on Aging and your local Agency on Aging(link is external) are good places to start.
 
 These tips can help you maintain your physical health as well as mental health. Learn the signs of a mental health condition, and talk to your doctor or nurse about your mental health.

78,0,"How do I know if I have a mental health condition?
 
 Understanding what is considered ""normal"" mental health can be difficult. For example, when does nervousness become a phobia? When does ""just feeling sad"" become depression, which is a serious condition? A mental health professional can help you figure out whether you have a mental health condition. If you do, treatment can help you feel better. People can and do recover from mental health conditions.
 
 How can I tell if I have a mental health condition?
 
 If you're experiencing a change in your thoughts, behaviors, or moods that is interfering with your work or relationships for longer than 2 weeks, you may have a mental health condition. It can be difficult to tell whether you have a mental health condition if you feel sadness, anxiety, or other intense emotions most of the time. Many mental health conditions first appear early in life, usually before 25 years old.
 
 Symptoms of a mental health condition can include extreme anxiety most of the time, feelings of hopelessness about everything, or drug or alcohol abuse.
 
 If you are in any doubt about your mental health, reach out to your doctor or nurse, a mental health professional, or a trusted loved one for help. If you have health insurance, this type of health care might be called ""behavioral health"" by your insurance plan. Many insurance plans call problems with drug or alcohol misuse ""substance abuse"" services.
 
 Are mental health conditions really medical problems?
 
 Yes. Mental health conditions are medical problems and can have just as big an effect on your life as physical problems. Researchers know that the brains of people with mental health conditions often work differently from others. Some mental health conditions are related to higher or lower levels of certain brain chemicals. Events such as violence, abuse, and other traumatic experiences can make mental health conditions worse or more difficult to manage.
 
 Many people with mental health conditions may be embarrassed to talk to a counselor or doctor or nurse about mental health or may think it's a sign of weakness. But mental health conditions are health problems just like physical illnesses, and getting help when you need it is actually a sign of strength. If you are concerned about your mental health, do not hesitate to talk to someone or get help.
 
 What are the symptoms of a mental health condition?
 
 Talk to a mental health professional if you are experiencing:
 
 ? A lack of interest in things that you used to enjoy
 
 ? Crying spells
 
 ? Lack of motivation
 
 ? Inability to concentrate
 
 ? Significant changes in your eating or sleeping patterns
 
 ? An inability to cope with problems or daily activities
 
 ? More anxiety than usual over events or situations
 
 ? Feelings of hopelessness
 
 ? Sudden changes in your personality for no reason
 
 ? An inability to stop thinking about certain ideas or memories
 
 ? Sadness for longer than 2 weeks
 
 ? Thoughts about suicide (call 911 if you are in immediate danger)
 
 ? Drug or alcohol abuse or illegal use of prescription drugs
 
 ? Extreme mood swings
 
 ? Violent behavior or a lot of anger or hostility
 
 ? Hearing voices or seeing things that other people don't hear or see
 
 How are mental health conditions diagnosed?
 
 There is no one test for mental health conditions. Your doctor, nurse, or a mental health professional may ask you about your symptoms and experiences and how long you've had them and talk with you about ways to deal with them.
 
 How are mental health conditions treated?
 
 Treatment for a mental health condition depends on the specific condition and how severe it is. Your doctor, nurse, or therapist may give you medicine, or your doctor or nurse may refer you for therapy, or do both. In very rare but serious cases when your life is in danger, such as a suicide attempt, you may need to stay at a hospital or other treatment facility.
 
 There are also different types of therapy for different types of mental health conditions. For example, phobias (fears of specific things or situations that make a person avoid everyday activities) are treated differently from depression. Certain types of therapy can teach you skills to retrain how you think or act.
 
 Other types of support that can help include building life skills (such as how to find a job or a place to live), learning how to manage your thoughts, eating healthy and exercising, finding a new community (such as a place of worship or a hobby group), and joining support groups.
 
 Does mental health treatment work?
 
 Yes, people can get better with treatment and other types of support. Different types of supports and treatments might work for different people. Try different types of treatment and support until you find what works for you. You may need to try different approaches at different times in life.
 
 How can I help make my treatment work?
 
 If you have been diagnosed with a mental health condition, it's important that you follow the advice of your mental health professional. You may need more than one treatment or a different treatment if your symptoms do not get better.
 
 * Take your medicines as directed. Some medicines take time to work. Medicines may also have side effects. Work with your doctor or nurse to find the medicine that works best for you. Some people stop taking the medicine once they start feeling better, but this can be risky. Stopping a medicine very suddenly may cause serious side effects, including thoughts of suicide. Try not to stop taking medicine without talking to your doctor or nurse first. If you have concerns about your medicine, let your doctor or nurse know so you can work together to adjust the amount of medicine or find a different medicine.
 
 * Participate fully in therapy. Therapy, sometimes called ""talk therapy,"" works best when you attend sessions as scheduled, are honest with yourself and your therapist, and do any ""homework"" between sessions.
 
 * Reach out to friends and family or others for support. You are not alone. There are people who want to help you. If you are having thoughts about hurting yourself or someone else, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline(link is external) at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
 
 * Learn steps you can take to stay mentally healthy. Get enough sleep, make healthy eating choices, and get regular physical activity. Learn more steps you can take to support good mental health.
 
 Will the medicine I take make me gain weight?
 
 Maybe. Some medicines that doctors prescribe for mental health conditions can make women more likely to gain weight than other types of medicine. This may be due to how your body processes the medicine. It may also be because getting treatment for a mental health condition can improve your appetite if you weren't eating well before treatment.1
 
 The most common medicines linked to weight gain are a type of medicine called antipsychotics, often used to treat schizophrenia (a serious mental health condition). Some antidepressants and mood stabilizers, which can be used to treat depression and bipolar disorder, can also increase the chances of gaining weight.2
 
 All medicines have risks. Talk to your doctor or nurse about the benefits and risks of your medicines. If you're concerned about gaining weight from your medicine, talk to your doctor or nurse about whether a different medicine or treatment method may work better.
 
 How can I get help paying for mental health treatment?
 
 Most health insurance plans cover mental health treatment in the same ways they cover medical or surgical treatments. There is not a different copay, coinsurance, or deductible for mental health treatment.
 
 * If you have insurance, check with your insurance provider to find out what's included in your plan. If you have insurance through your employer, you may be able to get help through an employee assistance program (EAP). Through your EAP, you may be able to get short-term counseling for stress, mental health symptoms, and substance abuse.
 
 * If you have Medicaid, your plan will provide some mental health services. Some plans offer substance use disorder services.
 
 * If you have Medicare, your plan may help cover mental health services, including hospital stays, visits to a therapist, and medicines you may need.
 
 If you do not have insurance, use the mental health services locator on this page to find free or low-cost care on a sliding scale according to your income.

86,1,"Depression
 
 Life is full of ups and downs, but when you feel sad, empty, or hopeless most of the time for at least 2 weeks or those feelings keep you from your regular activities, you may have depression. Depression is a serious mental health condition. In the past year, women were almost twice as likely as men to have symptoms of depression.1 Depression is not a normal part of being a woman. Most women, even those with the most severe depression, can get better with treatment.
 
 What is depression?
 
 Depression is a mental health illness when someone feels sad (including crying often), empty, or hopeless most of the time (or loses interest in or takes no pleasure in daily activities) for at least 2 weeks. Depression affects a person's ability to work, go to school, or have relationships with friends and family. Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions in the United States.2 It is an illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts. It can affect the way you eat and sleep, the way you feel about yourself, and the way you think about things.
 
 It is different from feeling ""blue"" or ""down"" or just sad for a few hours or a couple of days. Depression is also different from grief over losing a loved one or experiencing sadness after a trauma or difficult event. It is not a condition that can be willed or wished away. People who have depression cannot just ""pull themselves"" out of it.
 
 Are there different types of depression?
 
 Yes. Different kinds of depression include:
 
 ? Major depressive disorder. Also called major depression, this is a combination of symptoms that affects a person's ability to sleep, work, study, eat, and enjoy hobbies and everyday activities.
 
 ? Dysthymic disorder. Also called dysthymia, this kind of depression lasts for 2 years or more. The symptoms are less severe than those of major depression but can prevent you from living normally or feeling well.
 
 Other types of depression have slightly different symptoms and may start after a certain event. These types of depression include:
 
 * Psychotic depression, when a severe depressive illness happens with some form of psychosis, such as a break with reality, hallucinations, and delusions
 
 * Postpartum depression, which is diagnosed if a new mother has a major depressive episode after delivery. Depression can also begin during pregnancy, called prenatal depression.
 
 * Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which is a depression during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight
 
 * Bipolar depression, which is the depressive phase of bipolar illness and requires different treatment than major depression
 
 Who gets depression?
 
 Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression.1 It is more than twice as common for African-American, Hispanic, and white women to have depression compared to Asian-American women. Depression is also more common in women whose families live below the federal poverty line.3
 
 What causes depression?
 
 There is no single cause of depression. Also, different types of depression may have different causes. There are many reasons why a woman may have depression:
 
 * Family history. Women with a family history of depression may be more at risk. But depression can also happen in women who don't have a family history of depression.
 
 * Brain changes. The brains of people with depression look and function differently from those of people who don't have depression.
 
 * Chemistry. In someone who has depression, parts of the brain that manage mood, thoughts, sleep, appetite, and behavior may not have the right balance of chemicals.
 
 * Hormone levels. Changes in the female hormones estrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum period, perimenopause, or menopause may all raise a woman's risk for depression. Having a miscarriage can also put a woman at higher risk for depression.
 
 * Stress. Serious and stressful life events, or the combination of several stressful events, such as trauma, loss of a loved one, a bad relationship, work responsibilities, caring for children and aging parents, abuse, and poverty, may trigger depression in some people.
 
 * Medical problems. Dealing with a serious health problem, such as stroke, heart attack, or cancer, can lead to depression. Research shows that people who have a serious illness and depression are more likely to have more serious types of both conditions.4 Some medical illnesses, like Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and stroke, can cause changes in the brain that can trigger depression.
 
 * Pain. Women who feel emotional or physical pain for long periods are much more likely to develop depression.5 The pain can come from a chronic (long-term) health problem, accident, or trauma such as sexual assault or abuse.
 
 What are the symptoms of depression?
 
 Not all people with depression have the same symptoms. Some people might have only a few symptoms, while others may have many. How often symptoms happen, how long they last, and how severe they are may be different for each person.
 
 If you have any of the following symptoms for at least 2 weeks, talk to a doctor or nurse or mental health professional:
 
 * Feeling sad, ""down,"" or empty, including crying often
 
 * Feeling hopeless, helpless, worthless, or useless
 
 * Loss of interest in hobbies and activities that you once enjoyed
 
 * Decreased energy
 
 * Difficulty staying focused, remembering, or making decisions
 
 * Sleeplessness, early morning awakening, or oversleeping and not wanting to get up
 
 * Lack of appetite, leading to weight loss, or eating to feel better, leading to weight gain
 
 * Thoughts of hurting yourself
 
 * Thoughts of death or suicide
 
 * Feeling easily annoyed, bothered, or angered
 
 * Constant physical symptoms that do not get better with treatment, such as headaches, upset stomach, and pain that doesn't go away
 
 How is depression linked to other health problems?
 
 Depression is linked to many health problems in women, including:6
 
 * Heart disease. People with heart disease are about twice as likely to have depression as people who don't have heart disease.7
 
 * Obesity. Studies show that 43% of adults with depression have obesity. Women, especially white women, with depression are more likely to have obesity than women without depression are.8 Women with depression are also more likely than men with depression to have obesity.8
 
 * Cancer. Up to 1 in 4 people with cancer may also experience depression. More women with cancer than men with cancer experience depression.9
 
 How is depression diagnosed?
 
 Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have symptoms of depression. Certain medicines and some health problems (such as viruses or a thyroid disorder) can cause the same symptoms as depression. Sometimes depression can be part of another mental health condition.
 
 Diagnosis of depression includes a mental health professional asking questions about your life, emotions, struggles, and symptoms. The doctor, nurse, or mental health professional may order lab tests on a sample of your blood or urine and do a regular checkup to rule out other problems that could be causing your symptoms.
 
 How is depression treated?
 
 Your doctor or mental health professional may treat depression with therapy, medicine, or a combination of the two. Your doctor or nurse may refer you to a mental health specialist for therapy.
 
 Some people with milder forms of depression get better after a few months of therapy. People with moderate to severe depression might need therapy and a type of medicine called an antidepressant. Antidepressants change the levels of certain chemicals in your brain. It may take several weeks for antidepressants to work. There are different types of antidepressant medicines, and some work better than others for certain people. Some people get better only with both treatments - therapy and antidepressants. Learn what you can do if these treatments don't help.
 
 Having depression can make some people more likely to turn to drugs or alcohol to cope. But drugs or alcohol can make your mental health condition worse and can affect how antidepressants work. Talk to your therapist or doctor or nurse about any alcohol or drug use.
 
 What if the treatments I try for depression don't work?
 
 Give treatments time to work. It may take several weeks for the antidepressants to start working. Do not suddenly stop taking medicine for depression without talking to your doctor or nurse first.
 
 If you have major depressive disorder and have tried at least 2 types of antidepressants but your symptoms are not getting better, you may have treatment-resistant depression. If you have this type of depression, you may be able to try a treatment called esketamine. Esketamine is a nasal spray that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment-resistant depression when taken together with an antidepressant.10 Do not take esketamine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor or nurse about the benefits and risks of esketamine. Learn more about esketamine from the FDA.
 
 If you have severe depression, you can also ask your doctor or nurse if electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and other brain stimulation therapies are treatment options.11 Learn more about ECT from the National Institutes of Mental Health.
 
 I think I may have depression. How can I get help?
 
 Talk to someone like a doctor, nurse, psychiatrist, mental health professional, or social worker about your symptoms. You can also find no-cost or low-cost help in your state by using the mental health services locator on the top left side (desktop view) or bottom (mobile view) of this page.
 
 What if I have thoughts of hurting myself?
 
 If you are thinking about hurting or even killing yourself, get help now. Call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline(link is external) at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
 
 You might feel like your pain is too overwhelming to bear, but those feelings don't last forever. People do make it through suicidal thoughts. Many thoughts of suicide are impulses that go away after a short period of time.12
 
 Can I take St. John's wort to treat depression?
 
 Taking St. John's wort for depression has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Studies show mixed results about the plant's ability to treat depression.13
 
 It may be dangerous to take St. John's wort if you also take other medicines. St. John's wort can make many medicines not work at all or may cause dangerous or life-threatening side effects. The medicines used to treat heart disease, HIV, depression, seizures, certain cancers, and organ transplant rejection may not work or may have dangerous side effects if taken with St. John's wort. St. John's wort may also make birth control pills not work, which increases the chance you will get pregnant when you don't want to.14 It is crucial that you tell your doctor or nurse if you take St. John's wort.
 
 Depression is a serious mental illness that can be successfully treated with therapy and FDA-approved medicines. FDA-approved medicines and natural treatments can have side effects. It's best to talk to a doctor or nurse about treatment for depression.
 
 Does exercise help treat depression?
 
 For some people, yes. Researchers think that exercise may work better than no treatment at all to treat depression.15 They also think that regular exercise can lower your risk of getting depression and help many depression symptoms get better.16 Researchers do not know whether exercise works as well as therapy or medicine to treat depression.15 People with depression often find it very difficult to exercise, even though they know it will help make them feel better. Walking is a good way to begin exercising if you haven't exercised recently.
 
 Are there other natural or complementary treatments for depression?
 
 Researchers are studying natural and complementary treatments (add-on treatments to medicine or therapy) for depression. Currently, none of the natural or complementary treatments are proven to work as well as medicine and therapy for depression. However, natural or complementary treatments that have little or no risk, like exercise, meditation, or relaxation training, may help improve your depression symptoms and usually will not make them worse.
 
 Will treatment for depression affect my chances of getting pregnant?
 
 Maybe. Some medicines, such as some types of antidepressants, may make it more difficult for you to get pregnant, but more research is needed.17 Talk to your doctor about other treatments for depression that don't involve medicine if you are trying to get pregnant. For example, a type of talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps women with depression.18 This type of therapy has little to no risk for women trying to get pregnant. During CBT, you work with a mental health professional to explore why you are depressed and train yourself to replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Certain mental health care professionals specialize in depression related to infertility.
 
 Women who are already taking an antidepressant and who are trying to get pregnant should talk to their doctor or nurse about the risks and benefits of stopping the medicine. Learn more about taking medicines during pregnancy in our Pregnancy section.

91,1,"Postpartum depression
 
 Your body and mind go through many changes during and after pregnancy. If you feel empty, emotionless, or sad all or most of the time for longer than 2 weeks during or after pregnancy, reach out for help. If you feel like you don't love or care for your baby, you might have postpartum depression. Treatment for depression, such as therapy or medicine, works and will help you and your baby be as healthy as possible in the future.
 
 What is postpartum depression?
 
 ""Postpartum"" means the time after childbirth. Most women get the ""baby blues,"" or feel sad or empty, within a few days of giving birth. For many women, the baby blues go away in 3 to 5 days. If your baby blues don't go away or you feel sad, hopeless, or empty for longer than 2 weeks, you may have postpartum depression. Feeling hopeless or empty after childbirth is not a regular or expected part of being a mother.
 
 Postpartum depression is a serious mental illness that involves the brain and affects your behavior and physical health. If you have depression, then sad, flat, or empty feelings don't go away and can interfere with your day-to-day life. You might feel unconnected to your baby, as if you are not the baby's mother, or you might not love or care for the baby. These feelings can be mild to severe.
 
 Mothers can also experience anxiety disorders during or after pregnancy.
 
 How common is postpartum depression?
 
 Depression is a common problem after pregnancy. One in 9 new mothers has postpartum depression.1
 
 How do I know if I have postpartum depression?
 
 Some normal changes after pregnancy can cause symptoms similar to those of depression. Many mothers feel overwhelmed when a new baby comes home. But if you have any of the following symptoms of depression for more than 2 weeks, call your doctor, nurse, or midwife:
 
 ? Feeling restless or moody
 
 ? Feeling sad, hopeless, or overwhelmed
 
 ? Crying a lot
 
 ? Having thoughts of hurting the baby
 
 ? Having thoughts of hurting yourself
 
 ? Not having any interest in the baby, not feeling connected to the baby, or feeling as if your baby is someone else's baby
 
 ? Having no energy or motivation
 
 ? Eating too little or too much
 
 ? Sleeping too little or too much
 
 ? Having trouble focusing or making decisions
 
 ? Having memory problems
 
 ? Feeling worthless, guilty, or like a bad mother
 
 ? Losing interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy
 
 ? Withdrawing from friends and family
 
 ? Having headaches, aches and pains, or stomach problems that don't go away
 
 Some women don't tell anyone about their symptoms. New mothers may feel embarrassed, ashamed, or guilty about feeling depressed when they are supposed to be happy. They may also worry they will be seen as bad mothers. Any woman can become depressed during pregnancy or after having a baby. It doesn't mean you are a bad mom. You and your baby don't have to suffer. There is help. Your doctor can help you figure out whether your symptoms are caused by depression or something else.
 
 What causes postpartum depression?
 
 Hormonal changes may trigger symptoms of postpartum depression. When you are pregnant, levels of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone are the highest they'll ever be. In the first 24 hours after childbirth, hormone levels quickly drop back to normal, pre-pregnancy levels. Researchers think this sudden change in hormone levels may lead to depression.2 This is similar to hormone changes before a woman's period but involves much more extreme swings in hormone levels.
 
 Levels of thyroid hormones may also drop after giving birth. The thyroid is a small gland in the neck that helps regulate how your body uses and stores energy from food. Low levels of thyroid hormones can cause symptoms of depression. A simple blood test can tell whether this condition is causing your symptoms. If so, your doctor can prescribe thyroid medicine.
 
 Other feelings may contribute to postpartum depression. Many new mothers say they feel:
 
 * Tired after labor and delivery
 
 * Tired from a lack of sleep or broken sleep
 
 * Overwhelmed with a new baby
 
 * Doubts about their ability to be a good mother
 
 * Stress from changes in work and home routines
 
 * An unrealistic need to be a perfect mom
 
 * Grief about loss of who they were before having the baby
 
 * Less attractive
 
 * A lack of free time
 
 These feelings are common among new mothers. But postpartum depression is a serious health condition and can be treated. Postpartum depression is not a regular or expected part of being a new mother.
 
 Are some women more at risk of postpartum depression?
 
 Yes. You may be more at risk of postpartum depression if you:3
 
 * Have a personal history of depression or bipolar disorder
 
 * Have a family history of depression or bipolar disorder
 
 * Do not have support from family and friends
 
 * Were depressed during pregnancy
 
 * Had problems with a previous pregnancy or birth
 
 * Have relationship or money problems
 
 * Are younger than 20
 
 * Have alcoholism, use illegal drugs, or have some other problem with drugs
 
 * Have a baby with special needs
 
 * Have difficulty breastfeeding
 
 * Had an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy
 
 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that doctors look for and ask about symptoms of depression during and after pregnancy, regardless of a woman's risk of depression.4
 
 What is the difference between ""baby blues"" and postpartum depression?
 
 Many women have the baby blues in the days after childbirth. If you have the baby blues, you may:
 
 * Have mood swings
 
 * Feel sad, anxious, or overwhelmed
 
 * Have crying spells
 
 * Lose your appetite
 
 * Have trouble sleeping
 
 The baby blues usually go away in 3 to 5 days after they start. The symptoms of postpartum depression last longer and are more severe. Postpartum depression usually begins within the first month after childbirth, but it can begin during pregnancy or for up to a year after birth.5
 
 Postpartum depression needs to be treated by a doctor or nurse.
 
 What is postpartum psychosis?
 
 Postpartum psychosis is rare. It happens in up to 4 new mothers out of every 1,000 births. It usually begins in the first 2 weeks after childbirth. It is a medical emergency. Women who have bipolar disorder or another mental health condition called schizoaffective disorder have a higher risk of postpartum psychosis. Symptoms may include:
 
 * Seeing or hearing things that aren't there
 
 * Feeling confused most of the time
 
 * Having rapid mood swings within several minutes (for example, crying hysterically, then laughing a lot, followed by extreme sadness)
 
 * Trying to hurt yourself or your baby
 
 * Paranoia (thinking that others are focused on harming you)
 
 * Restlessness or agitation
 
 * Behaving recklessly or in a way that is not normal for you
 
 What should I do if I have symptoms of postpartum depression?
 
 Call your doctor, nurse, midwife, or pediatrician if:
 
 * Your baby blues don't go away after 2 weeks
 
 * Symptoms of depression get more and more intense
 
 * Symptoms of depression begin within 1 year of delivery and last more than 2 weeks
 
 * It is difficult to work or get things done at home
 
 * You cannot care for yourself or your baby (e.g., eating, sleeping, bathing)
 
 * You have thoughts about hurting yourself or your baby
 
 Ask your partner or a loved one to call for you if necessary. Your doctor, nurse, or midwife can ask you questions to test for depression. They can also refer you to a mental health professional for help and treatment.
 
 What can I do at home to feel better while seeing a doctor for postpartum depression?
 
 Here are some ways to begin feeling better or getting more rest, in addition to talking to a health care professional:
 
 * Rest as much as you can. Sleep when the baby is sleeping.
 
 * Don't try to do too much or to do everything by yourself. Ask your partner, family, and friends for help.
 
 * Make time to go out, visit friends, or spend time alone with your partner.
 
 * Talk about your feelings with your partner, supportive family members, and friends.
 
 * Talk with other mothers so that you can learn from their experiences.
 
 * Join a support group. Ask your doctor or nurse about groups in your area.
 
 * Don't make any major life changes right after giving birth. More major life changes in addition to a new baby can cause unneeded stress. Sometimes big changes can't be avoided. When that happens, try to arrange support and help in your new situation ahead of time.
 
 It can also help to have a partner, a friend, or another caregiver who can help take care of the baby while you are depressed. If you are feeling depressed during pregnancy or after having a baby, don't suffer alone. Tell a loved one and call your doctor right away.
 
 How is postpartum depression treated?
 
 The common types of treatment for postpartum depression are:
 
 * Therapy. During therapy, you talk to a therapist, psychologist, or social worker to learn strategies to change how depression makes you think, feel, and act.
 
 * 
 
 Medicine. There are different types of medicines for postpartum depression. All of them must be prescribed by your doctor or nurse. The most common type is antidepressants. Antidepressants can help relieve symptoms of depression and some can be taken while you're breastfeeding. Antidepressants may take several weeks to start working.
 
 * 
 
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved a medicine called brexanolone to treat postpartum depression in adult women.6 Brexanolone is given by a doctor or nurse through an IV for 21/2 days (60 hours). Because of the risk of side effects, this medicine can only be given in a clinic or office while you are under the care of a doctor or nurse. Brexanolone may not be safe to take while pregnant or breastfeeding.
 
 * 
 
 Another type of medicine called esketamine can treat depression and is given as a nasal (nose) spray in a doctor's office or clinic. Esketamine can hurt an unborn baby. You should not take esketamine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
 
 * 
 
 * Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This can be used in extreme cases to treat postpartum depression.
 
 These treatments can be used alone or together. Talk with your doctor or nurse about the benefits and risks of taking medicine to treat depression when you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
 
 Having depression can affect your baby. Getting treatment is important for you and your baby. Taking medicines for depression or going to therapy does not make you a bad mother or a failure. Getting help is a sign of strength.
 
 What can happen if postpartum depression is not treated?
 
 Untreated postpartum depression can affect your ability to parent. You may:
 
 * Not have enough energy
 
 * Have trouble focusing on the baby's needs and your own needs
 
 * Feel moody
 
 * Not be able to care for your baby
 
 * Have a higher risk of attempting suicide
 
 Feeling like a bad mother can make depression worse. It is important to reach out for help if you feel depressed.
 
 Researchers believe postpartum depression in a mother can affect her child throughout childhood, causing:7
 
 * Delays in language development and problems learning
 
 * Problems with mother-child bonding
 
 * Behavior problems
 
 * More crying or agitation
 
 * Shorter height8 and higher risk of obesity in pre-schoolers9
 
 * Problems dealing with stress and adjusting to school and other social situations10

96,0,"DEPRESSION FAQS
 
 Depression is common. But it's important to recognise the warning signs
 
 What is depression?
 
 We all feel down from time to time. But with time we get over it. Depression is feeling sad for weeks, months or longer. It is a normal reaction to too many stressful situations at once and will affect most people at sometime in their lives (about one in ten of us in any one year).
 
 How do you know if you're depressed?
 
 When you're feeling down, make an effort to think about what's been going on in your life recently. The big things that have happened to you might make you prone to depression or anger but sometimes it's the little things that we don't notice, like not getting enough sleep, which trigger it off. Getting to know your own patterns can make the difference.
 
 Look at the big three areas in our lives - work, relationships and home life. Short-term ups and downs are normal but when you start having long-term problems in one or more of these areas, the stress will mount. That's not because you're weak; that's because you're normal. 
 
 Is it about childhood or genes?
 
 People who have had tough upbringings tend to release more cortisol hormone in stressful situations than those who haven't. But you don't have to have 'had it tough' for childhood to leave its mark. Anything painful that you haven't talked about - or at least thought about - can come back to affect you as an adult. Could the way you feel and behave today be related to something unresolved from your past?
 
 Genes may also play a role in how we respond, but the way our genes are expressed can be altered by our experiences, and our brains are especially malleable - or 'plastic' - in our early years. Even as adults we can rewire our brains to respond in more useful ways (through, for example, CBT or mindfulness). 
 
 It's about working out your own triggers, how they affect you and how you can avoid or reduce them. 
 
 What are the warning signs?
 
 Here are the common signs that things are beginning to get on top of you:
 
 ? Feeling really tired and lacking in energy
 
 ? Withdrawing from family and friends
 
 ? Finding it hard to concentrate and struggling at work
 
 ? Losing interest in things you usually enjoy
 
 ? Behaving out of character
 
 ? Mood swings
 
 ? Dramatic sleep or appetite changes 
 
 ? Having unusual experiences, like seeing or hearing things that others don't.
 
 Sometimes it's hard to notice these things. Family or friends may notice it first (so it makes sense to listen to them even if you don't see the same thing). But knowing what to look out for means you can take action yourself.
 
 Frequent mood swings could be a sign that you're bottling up a problem or an addiction or perhaps have a mental health problem such as bipolar disorder. Talk to your GP. 
 
 What helps?
 
 * Make sure you're eating properly
 
 * Make sure you're sleeping properly
 
 * Exercise to blow off the blues
 
 * Sing, dance and laugh - they all boost and singing helps you take back control of your breathing
 
 * Avoid isolating yourself - stay in touch with family and friends
 
 * Be creative - play music, paint. Any one can write and putting down on paper how you feel can help you make sense of it.
 
 * Turn off autopilot - try to enjoy the moment you're in rather than regretting the past or freeting about the future
 
 * Volunteer - helping others helps us
 
 * Learn - take a class or learn a new skill
 
 * Keep it simple - sticking to a simple daily routine will help you regain control
 
 What about therapy?
 
 There are many talking therapies. From one-off counselling sessions to long-term, in-depth psychotherapy, each uses a slightly different approach. Some are one-to-one with a therapist, others are done in groups. Some men prefer the privacy of individual therapy; others find hearing from others with similar experiences useful. Your call. 
 
 Recently the NHS has become interested in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). It works by enabling you to recognise the patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviour that lead to difficulties in your life, and looking at ways of shifting these patterns through the way you think and what you do. It doesn't focus on the past but on improving the present. Unlike some therapy, it may only take a few sessions to help you understand your stress - a bit longer (12 sessions) to help with depression. The website Living Life to the Full offers a free introduction to CBT online. 
 
 Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy combines meditation techniques with CBT. Great if you want a more practical approach.
 
 If you think that talking therapy might be useful for you, do some research into the various types and talk to your GP.
 
 Tell me about Mindfulness
 
 If you feel like you're always in a headlong rush, Mindfulness (or Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy or Mindfulness-based stress reduction) can teach you to recognise when your auto-pilot is dragging you into unhelpful thoughts and to return your attention to the moment, often using the breath as an 'anchor'. Sounds weird? Possibly - but there's a growing body of evidence that it works. Anyone can do it - there are books and local groups. Ask your GP about it. 
 
 What about drugs?
 
 In 2012, the number of prescriptions in England for anti-depressants topped 50 million for the first time. But drugs (usually anti-depressants called SSRIs) are no longer the automatic choice for GPs when people go to them with mood or stress problems. Some people find them useful but it's worth doing a bit of research first:
 
 * What are the side-effects?
 
 * How long before they should start working? (Most take 6-8 weeks.)
 
 * How long are you likely to have to take them for?
 
 * Are there alternatives to medication that might work better for you?
 
 * How easy are they to come off?
 
 Their benefits in cases of severe depression are generally accepted but there is debate about how useful they are for mild to moderate cases. Depending on your symptoms, you may need medication to stabilise mood before talking therapies and some of the other ideas discussed in this booklet will begin to help. Discuss it with your GP. Your local pharmacist may also be useful.

104,0,"SUICIDE FAQS
 
 What to do if you're feeling shit.
 
 I feel suicidal
 
 If you are having very black thoughts or considering killing yourself, talk to someone.
 
 If, for whatever reason, you cannot talk to family or friends, there are several organisations who can help:
 
 ? The Samaritans have a 24 hour phone line - 116 123 - staffed by trained volunteers who will talk to you about anything. Or you can email them (jo@samaritans.org). Or visit a local branch and just walk in and talk to someone - there are over 200 branches in the UK and Ireland. There's more information on the Samaritans website: www.samaritans.org including a self-help app.
 
 ? CALM also have a helpline that is open 5pm-midnight 365 days a year on 0800 585858. CALM specifically exist to reduce male suicide and are used to talking to men about how they're feeling. There's more information about CALM on their website: www.thecalmzone.net. You'll also find more information about some of the issues that make men feel suicidal.
 
 Both organisations are excellent. If you've come to the MHF website looking for help, these two organisations are the people to talk to. They're totally confidential and private - you can talk about anything.
 
 If you feel you can see your GP, do that. Other things you can do if you're feeling suicidal are:
 
 * walk into the local A&E department and tell them how you're feeling
 
 * contact the NHS 111 phone line
 
 Suicidal feelings are a response to extreme stress so you need to remove yourself from the stressful situation. Do anything that reduces your feelings of anxiety. Go for a walk. Run. Read. Listen to music. 
 
 Do any of these.
 
 But suicide seems like the only solution
 
 If you're are in pain and you want the pain to stop, killing yourself may feel like a way of ending it. You may feel it is the only solution you have or the only way you can take control of what feels like an impossible situation. But these are feelings. It important for us to recognise our feelings and these may be quite natural feelings in many cases - but they are only feelings. Try to separate feelings from facts. These are facts:
 
 * Many people have felt like this at some time or another - perhaps the majority of people - and nearly all of them did not kill themselves.
 
 * Our feelings change. You feel like this now but you have not always felt like this so you probably won't always feel like this in the future.
 
 * If you feel so bad that you're considering killing yourself, you are at rock bottom. You feel as bad as a human being can possibly feel so you have nothing to lose by talking to someone. And it might make things better.
 
 Look at the numbers. Each year, about 6,000 people take their own lives a year (6,507 in 2018) yet The Samaritans receive nearly six million calls for help, many of these from people who said they wanted to kill themselves. In other words, a lot of people consider suicide but far fewer do it and these numbers prove that talking to an organisation such as The Samaritans can make a difference. You have nothing to lose.
 
 On the MHF website you'll find information for you to use as you wish. Nowhere on the MHF website will you be told what's best. Except here. If you're feeling suicidal, it's best to tell someone.
 
 Why do people feel suicidal?
 
 We don't really know. But all of these things may increase how likely we are to think about suicide:
 
 * life history - particularly traumatic events in childhood such as abuse or neglect
 
 * certain health conditions such as depression or schizophrenia
 
 * addictions to, for example, drugs or alcohol
 
 * having no job or a very insecure job
 
 * being lonely or bullied
 
 * being in debt or homeless
 
 * genes and family history
 
 * having a chronic illness and/or being in pain (more and more long-term problems can be relieved by the right medication so ask your GP)
 
 One or more of these can combine with a trigger event to send someone 'over the edge'.
 
 But look at the list. Not a single one can honestly be said to be your fault. We have no control over the illnesses we get or our genes or what happened to us when we were kids. 
 
 So, if you're feeling like this, it's not your fault. Tell someone.
 
 The problem is that this reality is sometimes in conflict with our ideas of what a man should be. The traditional idea is that a man should be in control. But it's impossible to be in control all the time. 
 
 It is estimated that a single edition of the New York Times contains more information than the average person in the seventeenth-century was likely to come across in a lifetime. And that estimate was 30 years ago. The world is changing. Today, you simply can't know everything. If we, as men in the 21st century, are not in control enough to understand that, we're going to be in trouble. 
 
 Most of us get it. If the toilet leaks, we don't think it's a sign of weakness or failure to call the plumber. But if you're feeling like crap and you don't know why, the same thing applies. There's no shame in asking an expert. Your GP can point you in the right direction.
 
 If you have financial problems or are in debt there is help available from, for example, Citizens Advice or the Money Advice Service.
 
 Can drugs make me feel suicidal?
 
 If you're feeling black, drink and drugs will not help. They may mask the feelings in the very short term but we all know that drink and drugs can make us more likely to do something we regret. Alcohol is actually a depressant so is likely to make you feel even lower.
 
 It's not just illegal drugs. Prescription anti-depressants may increase suicidal feelings when you first start so make sure somebody knows you're taking them (and tell your GP immediately if you have such feelings). 
 
 What are the warning signs?
 
 It's not easy to spot when someone is seriously considering suicide but signs can include:
 
 * threatening self-harm or suicide
 
 * talking or writing about it
 
 * actively looking at ways to do it (such as stocking up on tablets)
 
 * signs of hopelessness - 'what's the point?'
 
 * signs of feeling trapped - 'what can I do?'
 
 * sudden rages/anger
 
 * reckless or risky behaviour
 
 * changes in appetite - eating much more or less
 
 * changes in sleep patterns - sleeping a lot or very little
 
 * withdrawal - avoiding family and friends (online and off) and losing interest in anything including appearance
 
 * putting affairs in order - such as writing a will or sorting out/selling possessions
 
 If you spot a number of these in yourself, talk to someone. if you notice them in others, try to talk to them. Don't judge them or try to suggest solutions, just offer a listening ear and try to encourage them to seek professional help though their GP.

105,0,"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: YOU DISHING IT OUT?
 
 How to avoid being an abuser.
 
 What is domestic violence?
 
 Domestic violence can happen in any relationship and can happen to anyone. What is it?
 
 ?I am inflicting domestic violence
 
 Victims of domestic abuse are not the only ones who need help. It takes strength to admit that you are abusing your partner and courage to change.
 
 Recognising that your actions are damaging both your partner and your relationship is the first step to breaking the cycle of domestic violence. Some perpetrators have experienced abuse themselves and it can be challenging to recognise that you are now in the role of the abuser and that:
 
 ? You only need to abuse once to be an abuser.
 
 ? The impact of abuse doesn't stop when you do.
 
 ? However, you can stop and it is vital that you choose to do so.
 
 ? Abuse affects children, whether they see it or not.
 
 There is help and support for abusers and the sooner you get help the better it is for both you and your partner.
 
 How do I stop?
 
 Step 1
 
 * Recognise that you are abusive in your relationship.
 
 * Ask youself if your partner is frightened of you?
 
 * Is your relationship suffering because of your behaviour?
 
 * Domestic abuse comes in many forms, but it is always about control - forcing your partner to do what you want, when you want.
 
 Step 2
 
 * Recognise that your abusive behaviour affects your whole family.
 
 * Violence and abuse have a devastating effect on children. You may think that your children do not know what is going on because you are not abusive in front of them, but they will hear the abuse and sense the tension in the family. There is a lot of evidence to show that children are harmed by abuse even if they do not witness it. Alternatively they could be caught in the crossfire or may intervene to protect your partner.
 
 Step 3
 
 * Choose to stop.
 
 * Decide that you no longer want to control and abuse. Only you can take control over your own behaviour and learn not to be violent and abusive whatever the situation.
 
 Step 4
 
 * Take responsibility for your behaviour and for the abuse. Stop blaming your actions on your partner or on anything else, such as drink, drugs, stress or unemployment.
 
 * Do not minimise your behaviour by thinking that it isn't too bad. How bad does it need to be before you do anything?
 
 Step 5
 
 * Seek help.
 
 * You can promise yourself over and over again that it won't happen again, but it probably will if you do nothing more. Do something before the next time.
 
 How do I spot the warning signs?
 
 * Be aware when things are heating up and when you are getting into a situation where you may be abusive towards your partner.
 
 * Make a note of your sore spots. These may be typical situations when you have been abusive before.
 
 * Think about what is happening to you physically as you begin to become violent and abusive - your physical warning signs.
 
 * Think about what you begin to do. Do you point your finger, close your fist, pace up and down, shout, glare, interrupt, go quiet, issue orders, get right up close?
 
 * Watch out for feelings that come just before you become abusive or violent. Do you feel resentment? Anger? Trapped? Guilty? Upset? Hurt? These are your emotional warning signs.
 
 * Think about the negative things that you are saying to yourself as you get closer to being abusive - these are your mental warning signs. These will be negative things about your partner, things to justify
 
 * your actions such as 'he/she is doing this deliberately.'
 
 * Note also the things that you do not say to yourself such as how your partner is feeling, or trying to understand or listen to what your partner is saying. Remember - it is never too late to make another choice
 
 * You can walk away.
 
 * Right up to the moment you are abusive or violent, you can choose to do otherwise.
 
 ?What is a time out?
 
 Time out is the most basic alternative to being violent - if you are not near to your partner you cannot hurt or abuse them. It gives you space to calm down and reflect on your behaviour.
 
 Once you spot warning signs, you should get away for exactly one hour and leave the situation before things build up and you are violent.
 
 Calm yourself down. Walk, take some exercise, meditate or pray - or it may help to talk to a friend who is supporting you in being non abusive.
 
 Examine your behaviour. Think about your behaviour and any negative thoughts that you were having. Think about alternatives to your behaviour and what you are going to do or say when you get back to your partner. Remember you will need to be able to return and be different, rather than try to make your partner different.
 
 After an hour return home. Before you return home, call your partner to let them know that you have calmed down and are returning. If your partner wants to discuss the situation with you, do so in a non abusive and non blaming way. Do not force someone to talk to you when you want, as that would also be abusive. Respect your partner's wish not to discuss the situation and wait for a mutually convenient opportunity.
 
 Talk to your partner about Time Outs so that your partner knows ahead of time what strategy you are using to manage your violence.

106,0,"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: ON THE RECEIVING END?
 
 Are you being abused?
 
 What is domestic violence?
 
 Domestic violence can happen in any relationship and can happen to anyone. What is it?
 
 How do I know if I'm being abused?
 
 Each person's experience will be unique but if you are in an abusive relationship you may feel some or all of the following:
 
 ? Isolated. You may be afraid to tell anyone what is really going on for fear of being disbelieved or ridiculed. Men who are being abused may think that they will not be taken seriously or be unsure of whether they can actually be a 'victim' of domestic abuse.
 
 ? Confused about why a person you love can treat you this way, or confused because sometimes they are loving and kind.
 
 ? Confused about what they are saying with messages like 'I hate you' or later on 'don't leave me'.
 
 ? Frustrated and sad because you feel that you have tried everything and still cannot sort the relationship out.
 
 ? Depressed or anxious, humiliated by the ongoing abuse.
 
 ? Constantly on edge and worried about how your partner will react.
 
 ? Threatened by the behaviour of your partner.
 
 ? Guilty about leaving them, scared that you will not be able to find a new partner and live alone. Or scared of what will happen to your children and your relationship with them.
 
 ? Worried about financial security if you leave.
 
 ? Afraid of the repercussions if you take any action - like continued violence, becoming homeless, or losing contact with the children.
 
 ? Feeling paralysed - whatever you do will only make things worse
 
 ?But men aren't victims of domestic violence
 
 Not true. Many men who experience domestic abuse from a current or former partner find it difficult to get support not least because it can be hard for men to acknowledge and discuss their experiences. This silence can be due to any number of reasons, including love for a partner, embarrassment or shame and concern for any children, or simply not knowing where to go.
 
 Even so, it is vital you seek help if you are a victim of domestic abuse or are becoming one. Do not suffer in silence as there are people who can help you to live in a safer environment that is free of violence and abuse.
 
 Shouldn't men be able to handle it?
 
 No one should have to live with violence, fear or abuse.
 
 It is not true that men who experience domestic abuse are not 'real men'.  Domestic abuse is about power and control of one person over another. It can happen to any man, in both heterosexual and gay relationships and does not indicate that the man is 'weak' or 'ineffectual'.
 
 My abuser cannot help it
 
 There are many excuses given for violence and abusive behaviour: alcohol, stress, drugs, hormones, oppression, the inability to express feelings in any other way, anger, a traumatic childhood. But domestic abuse is chosen behaviour and there are no excuses for one person treating another in an aggressive and bullying way.
 
 I try to ignore it
 
 Ignoring it will not make it go away
 
 Men who experience domestic abuse may try different techniques to cope. Coping strategies include adopting an 'I can handle this' attitude, being careful about what you say, when and how you say it. You may have given up doing anything likely to upset your partner, adapting your behaviour to do what they demand such as:
 
 * Sleeping somewhere where you feel safer, including the car, hostels or at friends.
 
 * By staying late at work to avoid going home.
 
 * Using drugs or alcohol.
 
 * Leaving home.
 
 Coping may make life temporarily easier but it is unlikely to stop the abuse.
 
 What can I do?
 
 * Recognising that you are in an abusive relationship is an important first act. Things will not change for the better if you do nothing.
 
 * Keep a record of dates and times of incidents.
 
 * Report the violence to the police - visit your local station and ask to speak to a Domestic Violence Officer in confidence.
 
 * Seek medical attention for any injuries - do not cover up the true cause.
 
 * Seek legal advice.
 
 * Tell trusted family and friends what is going on.
 
 * Make safety arrangements such as organising a safe place to go, changing your telephone number and locks.
 
 * Protect the children.
 
 * Do not be provoked into retaliating, or you could find yourself being arrested.
 
 * Talk over your situation with one of the national or local domestic violence support agencies mentioned here.

107,0,"SELF-HARM FAQS
 
 Men self-harm too. But you can control it.
 
 Don't only girls self-harm?
 
 The 'official' statistics may suggest that females are far more likely to self-harm than males but self-harm is not uncommon in boys and men. Another myth is that only young people do it.
 
 What is self-harm?
 
 The term self-harm includes self-damaging behaviour - overeating, overdrinking, overdosing - and self-injury such as cutting yourself or burning yourself.
 
 Self-harm is complex and people do it for all sorts of reasons. Perhaps it's a way of turning mental or emotional pain into something that seems, at the time, to make more sense, to feel real. Perhaps it stops you turning your anger on other people. Or perhaps it just 'feels right' because you don't think very much of yourself. It has been called an 'inner scream'.
 
 But however you explain it, self-harm is not safe. It is dangerous in itself - you can kill yourself or do yourself permanent damage. It can also increase the risk of suicide. The evidence is that most people who self-harm have no intention of killing themselves at the time but there is a risk of later suicide if the behaviour doesn't stop.
 
 What can cause self-harm?
 
 All sorts of things can trigger self-harm:
 
 ? difficult relationships with friends or partners
 
 ? difficulties at school or work
 
 ? being bullied, either at home, school or work
 
 ? worries about money
 
 ? alcohol or drug misuse
 
 ? dealing with your sexuality
 
 ? coping with cultural expectations such as an arranged marriage
 
 ? sexual, physical or emotional abuse, including domestic abuse and rape
 
 ? the death of a close family member or friend
 
 ? having a miscarriage
 
 Sometimes it may be caused by an illness - for example, if voices tell you to cut yourself or you feel you have to do it or you find yourself so distracted you don't realise you've done it. It is even more important to see a GP is you're feeling like this.
 
 Certain forms of self-harming can become addictive. The body's natural pain-killers kick in when you cut or burn yourself and you get an adrenaline rush. But as with any drug you'll probably need more each time - and, again, that's going to be dangerous.
 
 What should I do if I'm self-harming?
 
 Whatever is behind your self-harm, harming yourself will not take those problems away. You could see self-harming as a sign that you have a problem that you need help solving.
 
 There is treatment available if you self-harm. Tell your GP. They will be able to help you and generally they won't tell anyone. (If you are under 16, a GP may involve others without your consent if he or she thinks you are in immediate danger.) The National institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) takes self-harm seriously and GPs will do the same, treating you with absolute respect.
 
 Things can change. The right form of help early on can help you stop the cycle of self harm.
 
 The following can all help too:
 
 * The Samaritans website or by phone: 116 123
 
 * Childline - can help with self harm if you're under 19 - http://www.childline.org.uk/Explore/Self-harm/Pages/about-self-harm.aspx

 * The National Self Harm Network have an online forum
 
 * The Mix, another site for young people, also has self-harm information

108,0,"MID-LIFE CRISIS FAQS
 
 Many fear a mid life crisis but there is a lot you can do to control these feelings
 
 Mid life crisis. That's not a real thing is it?
 
 Well, it depends who you ask. (Read Mid-life crisis: the best thing that ever happened to you?)
 
 There's no doubt that between the age of 35 and 55 men face some of the greatest pressures of their lives. Supporting families, juggling workplace demands, losing older relatives, having your own first brushes with mortality and recognising all those aspirational dreams you had in your 20s are not necessarily going to become true, there's a lot going at this time of life. Things can feel pretty critical but whether that adds up to a medical condition we can call a 'mid life crisis' (MLC) is another question. More that it is a reflection of the pressures of modern life on men and women.
 
 What is this I'm feeling then?
 
 A lot of significant events happen between the ages of 35 and 55. From reaching the end of our physical peaks to our parents passing away. These mid life stressors can accumulate and become a burden on our lives.
 
 What are the symptoms of men who feel like they are having a mid life crisis?
 
 It's not always the stereotypical man who, on turning 40, dons a leather jacket and buys a motorbike he doesn't know how to ride. More commonly men who describe themselves as having a MLC have symptoms such as;
 
 ? Irritability
 
 ? Loss of sex drive
 
 ? Erectile dysfunction
 
 ? Fatigue
 
 ? Depression, charactised by low moods and (often apparently unaccountable) feelings of sadness and lethargy
 
 ? Low levels of testosterone.
 
 Who has a mid life crisis?
 
 The good news is that fewer than a quarter of men describe having a MLC. As low as 1 in 10 in some surveys. So it may not be as inevitable as you might think. Having said that, part of the problem with the MLC is that blokes deny having them: 'I've always wanted a Ferrari', 'I've never been happy in this marriage' etc. Research suggests that men who tend to have the most difficulties with these symptoms during their 30s, 40s and 50s have been susceptible to mental health problems in their teens and 20s.
 
 What can I do about it?
 
 The NHS does not recognise MLC as a medical condition and there's certainly no particular medication for it. However, the NHS does treat many of the symptoms and most GPs will recognise that men of this age may be susceptible to mental health issues due to all these pressures. There is NHS information on the 'male menopause'. Your GP may offer you counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy. These are highly effective ways of treating many of the components of a MLC such as depression, fatigue and irritability. 
 
 What's the outlook?
 
 Potentially good. Ultimately, the mid-life crisis is about managing change of one kind or another, and as millions of older men can testify, there lies a fresh perspective and new satisfactions on the other side of the transition. The key thing is not to waste valuable years suffering in silence: always ask for help if you need it, and explore every avenue. Talk. Life can begin at any age you choose.

 If someone's trying to make you feel bad, that's not okay. We're here to help.
 
 DEALING WITH BULLYING
 
 Report it and block people
 
 If someone's harassing or bullying you online, you can report it on the site or app. Even if someone else has reported it, making a report yourself can make it more likely the content will be removed. Don't reply to abusive messages or posts as this can make things worse.
 
 Keep evidence
 
 Keep a diary of what's been happening and when, and take screenshots of online messages. This can help you prove what's been happening.
 
 Tell someone at school
 
 If you're being bullied by people at school, your school has a responsibility to support you. If you have screenshots or evidence of what's been happening, show them to a teacher you trust.
 
 Practise being assertive
 
 Being assertive means standing up for yourself without being aggressive. It can help you feel more confident and in control when someone's bullying you.
 
 Get support from someone you trust
 
 You don't have to cope with bullying alone. Talking to an adult you trust can help you to find ways to stop the bullying. If you don't know who to talk to, talk to us.
 
 Take a break from checking messages
 
 It's natural to want to see what people are saying when they're bullying you. But taking time away from your phone or device, even for a few minutes, can help you to feel calmer.
 
 Bounce back from bullying
 
 Being bullied can make you feel like things can never get better, but we've got a tool to help.
 
 Wall of Expression
 
 Worried? Frustrated? Write on the wall and then watch your worries crumble away.

 * being violent or physically assaulting you
 
 * sexually assaulting you
 
 * stealing things from you
 
 * bullying you because of your race, gender or sexual identity, or if you have a disability, this is hate crime

 SUPPORTING SOMEONE WHO'S BEING BULLIED
 
 It can be difficult to know where to start with helping someone who's being bullied. But just a few words of support and showing that you care can make a massive difference.
 
 * Let them know you're there for them
 
 Listening and letting someone who's being bullied know you're there if they want to chat can make a massive difference. Chatting to them regularly and saying you're there for them can help them feel less alone.
 
 * Help them to get support
 
 You could offer to go with them to report the bullying and help them think about what they want to say. Or you could help them report it on social media.
 
 * Think before you like or comment on something
 
 Liking, sharing or commenting on a post designed to bully someone can make it more popular and visible, even if you're not supporting it. Don't respond to a post, even if you're not sure if it's meant to bully someone. 
 
 * Help to distract them
 
 Help them to take their mind off things for a short while. You could watch a film, play sports or a game together.
 
 * Be positive around people
 
 Whether it's posting positive things online, or being friendly to people at school, being positive can help lots of people to feel better.
 
 HELP IF YOU'RE BULLYING SOMEONE
 
 Bullying someone else isn't okay. But if you're doing it and want to stop, there are things you can do:
 
 * Recognise what you're doing is bullying
 
 You might want to dismiss what's happened as just a joke, or think that it's okay because you're not the only one. But sending nasty messages, sharing a post or liking something that's been made to make someone feel bad, is bullying. It can be hard to accept this and we've got advice to help if you're feeling guilty.
 
 * Delete and don't send any more posts or messages
 
 Stop whatever you were doing to bully someone, don't post or share things and don't message the person. Go back and delete old posts or messages.
 
 * Don't stay on group chats or pages
 
 Even if you don't participate, if you stay on a group chat then you're encouraging other people.
 
 * Say sorry
 
 Apologise to the person you bullied or sent messages to. Offer them support if you can, but respect their wishes if they don't want to talk to you.
 
 * Encourage others to stop bullying too
 
 Talk to others who've been bullying and encourage them to stop. Sometimes it only takes one person to make a big change.
 
 * Plan for the future
 
 Think about how you want to behave online in the future, and what you could do if you want to do this again. Try asking an adult for help if you're struggling with difficult feelings.

 Video chat sites
 
 Tumblr
 
 Tik Tok featuring Musical.ly
 
 Periscope
 
 After you've made a report
 
 Not all sites will take content down straight away, and sometimes they might not take something down when you've made a report.
 
 Remember that you can keep making reports if you are concerned about something, but it can also help to talk to an adult you trust.
 
 Even when you've reported something it can still have an effect on you. No matter what's happening you can talk to Childline or get support from other young people on our message boards.
 
 HELPING SOMEONE ELSE
 
 It can be difficult seeing someone being bullied or harassed online. But there are lots of things you can do to help:
 
 Don't like, share or comment
 
 Even if you're replying to support someone, commenting, liking or sharing a post can make it more popular, which may mean more people see it. Commenting can also encourage the bullies to reply or say nasty things back. 
 
 Report posts and people
 
 You can help someone by reporting posts or people that are bullying on the social media platform. You can also show them how to block people. Encouraging and showing your friend how to block and report people or content on social media can help them know what to do if it happens again. 
 
 Speak to the person being bullied
 
 Talking to someone and letting them know you're there for them can be one of the best ways to support them. It can also help to do things you both enjoy together, like seeing a film or playing sports, to help take their mind off the bullying. 
 
 Keep your own posts positive
 
 It can be tempting to post negative things back to people who're bullying others online, but sometimes this can make things worse. Ignoring them and posting positive things yourself can help other people to do the same.

 WHAT IS DISCRIMINATION?
 
 Discrimination is when someone treats you differently, unfairly or worse because of your age, being disabled, your gender, gender identity, being married or in a civil partnership, being pregnant or having a child, your religion or beliefs, your race, skin colour or where you were born or your sexuality.
 
 Discrimination is against the law and can include:
 
 * being excluded from a sports team
 
 * being bullied by being ignored
 
 * not getting a job or being asked to change part of your religious beliefs for work
 
 * buildings that don't allow you access because of a disability
 
 * not being allowed into shops or restaurants.
 
 It can sometimes be difficult to describe your experience as there are many types of discrimination. Remember, you have the right to be treated fairly and with respect.
 
 What you can do
 
 1. Tell someone what's happening. This could be your teacher or your manager at work. They can help to make changes or support you.
 
 2. Follow policies or guidelines. Your school or employer have a duty to protect you from. discrimination. Find out about their discrimination policy so that you can report what's happened.
 
 3. Keep a record. Messages, videos or a diary of what's been happening can help when telling an adult or be used as evidence.
 
 4. Keep telling. You may have to speak out more than once about what's happening. It's okay to tell someone else if you don't feel it's being taken seriously.
 
 5. Tell the police. If you feel threatened or a crime has been committed you can speak to the police on 999 in an emergency or 101 at other times.

 HATE CRIME
 
 This is crime which includes prejudice or discrimination. You might be assaulted or have your belongings damaged. Hate crime is where the person focuses on your:
 
 * disability
 
 * race or ethnicity
 
 * religion or beliefs
 
 * sexual orientation
 
 * gender identity.
 
 It's still a hate crime if someone makes an assumption about your identity. For example, if someone does something because they think you're Muslim.
 
 Hate crime can happen online, in the street, at school, college, work or at home. You might feel frightened, threatened or angry about the abuse. Remember, hate crime is wrong and is never your fault. If you think you may be the victim of hate crime you can report it to the police on 999 in an emergency and 101 at other times.
 
 Facts about hate crime
 
 * Race hate crime includes all countries within the UK.
 
 * Refugees and asylum seekers can get support if they experience hate crime.
 
 * Both majority and minority groups are covered by the law.
 
 * There can be an increase in racially or religiously aggravated crimes after incidents like terrorist attacks. Remember, the police are there to protect you.
 
 * People can get a longer sentence for hate motivated crime.
 
 EQUALITY AND THE LAW
 
 Discrimination is against the law. That means that nobody has the right to treat you badly or differently because of your age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation. It also protects you if you're married or in a civil partnership, pregnant or you have children.
 
 Discrimination laws are different in different parts of the UK. The Equality Act 2010 applies to England, Scotland and Wales and the Race Relations (NI) Order 1997 applies to Northern Ireland.
 
 The Equalities Act is a law which sets out rules for employers, colleges, schools and services to follow to make sure everyone is treated the same. The law protects you in education, at work, if you join a club and when you buy things like food and clothes. You are entitled to be treated fairly and equally when you use services like travelling on the bus or seeing your doctor and when you rent or buy housing.
 
 Remember that any form of discrimination is wrong. You have the right to education, employment, housing, services and goods whoever you are.
 
 OTHER TYPES OF DISCRIMINATION
 
 Stereotypes
 
 A stereotype is an idea or assumption about a group of people. Stereotypes are not based on fact. Instead, stereotypes are based on opinions or feelings. Stereotypes can lead to prejudice and discrimination.
 
 Stereotypes are often negative and assume everyone in a certain group is the same or acts the same way. All groups are made up of people who have different personalities, strengths and weaknesses.
 
 Being treated differently because of a stereotype, like someone assuming your sexuality based on the clothes you wear, is a type of discrimination. Even when the assumption isn't true it's still discrimination. Discrimination can also happen through someone you know, like not being able to access a shop with a family member who is disabled.
 
 Assumptions
 
 Everyone makes assumptions and your views are influenced by the opinions of your family, friends, community and the media. The opinions you hear a lot can have a big effect on what you believe and you might not question them.
 
 You may not be aware of the assumptions that you make. Try listening to other views by talking to people outside of your social group at school or college, talking on the message boards or searching for information online that you wouldn't normally look for.
 
 Prejudice
 
 Prejudice is having a biased or unfair opinion about a group of people which isn't based on fact. Prejudice could be against a certain ethnicity, young or old people, men, women, people with religious beliefs, people who don't have a religion, or people with a disability.
 
 A person who doesn't want a certain group of people living near them is showing prejudice.
 
 Bullying
 
 Sometimes bullying includes discrimination, like if someone picks on you because of your race or sexuality. Sometimes people discriminate without realising what they're doing, like making racist jokes or calling someone insulting names. Whether it's done on purpose or not, bullying and discrimination is always wrong.
 
 Harassment
 
 Harassment is behaviour which frightens you and causes you distress or alarm. You might experience unwanted phone calls, broken windows or online abuse and feel humiliated, offended or threatened.
 
 You can be harassed by a stranger or by someone you know. There needs to be 2 or more incidents by the same person or group of people to be classed as harassment.
 
 If you think you're being harassed because of your disability, race, religion, transgender identity or sexual orientation, you can report it to the police as a hate crime.

 WHAT IS HOMOPHOBIA AND TRANSPHOBIA?
 
 Homophobia is when someone is scared of or dislikes gay/homosexual people.
 
 Transphobia is when someone is scared of or dislikes transgender people.
 
 It's never okay for someone to be bullied because of their sexuality or gender identity.
 
 Being bullied can have a big effect on how you feel, it can make it harder to come out or leave you feeling scared about sharing your feelings. But there are ways to cope and to help it stop. No matter what's happening, we're here to support you.
 
 Homophobic and transphobic bullying can include:
 
 * making comments about your gender or sexuality that deliberately make you uncomfortable
 
 * calling you names or teasing you
 
 * hitting, punching or hurting you
 
 * making sexual comments or asking you sexual questions
 
 * ignoring you or excluding you
 
 * making comments about you online.
 
 GETTING HELP AND STAYING SAFE
 
 Everyone has the right to feel safe and not be discriminated against. It can be tough if you're worried about what people will do or what they'll say to you
 
 Some things you can try:
 
 Listen to yourself
 
 Don't go to places that make you uncomfortable. If you get that uneasy feeling or tightness in your stomach, it's your body and mind telling you that something might not be right. Make sure you've got people you trust with you.
 
 Tell someone
 
 If you're worried about being bullied at school, tell an adult who you trust. If they don't help you, you can get support from the head teacher to make a complaint. Schools have to take bullying seriously and protect you.
 
 Keep a diary of what's happening
 
 Write down what happened, when and how it made you feel. This can be a really good way to gather evidence if you decide to tell someone.
 
 Tell the police
 
 If you're out in a public place and feel unsafe or scared, you can seek support from the police. You can also talk to them if someone has committed a hate crime or acted illegally towards you because of your gender or sexuality. You can call 101 to speak to the police or dial 999 in an emergency.
 
 Stay safe online
 
 The internet can be a great way to get support and feel less isolated. But make sure you report abusive behaviour online and block people who make nasty comments.

 BUILDING CONFIDENCE AFTER BULLYING
 
 Bullying can make it hard to feel confident about yourself and who you are. But you have the right to be who you are and that should always be respected. There are lots of ways to build confidence after bullying:
 
 * Remind yourself about who you are and what makes you proud
 
 You could write this down, draw a picture, make a poem or just say it in front of a mirror.
 
 * Talk to someone you trust
 
 When you feel accepted by someone you care about it can help build your confidence if you decide to tell other people.
 
 * Think about what makes you unique
 
 We all have differences and can learn a lot about each other if we talk about stuff like our hobbies and what we enjoy. If we were all the same, the world would be a really boring place!
 
 * Find other people who might be going through similar feelings
 
 You can join local clubs, check out our message boards or look for support groups online.

 OTHER TYPES OF PREJUDICE
 
 People sometimes talk about transphobia and homophobia when they're describing any prejudice against LGBTQ+ people. But there are other types of discrimination as well.
 
 Biphobia
 
 Biphobia is a fear or dislike of people who are bisexual (attracted to boys and girls). Just like homophobia, it's a form of discrimination.
 
 Sometimes bisexuality is seen as being just a phase. Or that they should 'make their minds up'. But all of these ideas are biphobic.
 
 There are lots of bisexual people in the world. And it's normal for some people to be bisexual. If someone is biphobic, that's a form of discrimination.
 
 Heterosexism
 
 Heterosexism is when people believe that straight (heterosexual) relationships are the 'norm' and are better than LGBTQ+ relationships. Heterosexism is a form of discrimination.
 
 Discrimination in sport
 
 Everyone has the right to take part in sport. There are lots of clubs and sports that are accepting of LGBTQ+ people but some young people do experience discrimination.
 
 Sometimes people will say homophobic things thinking that it's just 'banter'. But homophobia is never okay.
 
 When someone is transitioning, they should have support to help them feel comfortable when they get changed and should be supported to play sport with the gender they identify as.
 
 If you're feeling excluded or discriminated against it's important to talk to someone. This could be the coach, or someone you trust that could help support you. If you're not sure who to talk to you can speak to us.
 
 There are ways to report homophobic abuse without anyone knowing it was you who made the report. If you're at a football match and see homophobic abuse (or any other kind of discrimination), you can use the Kick It Out app to report what happened.

 BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY
 
 You might feel like you're being treated differently because of your faith or religion. This could be at school, college, by friends or with relatives. It's wrong for anyone to hurt, tease, ignore, threaten, tell jokes or call you names. It's bullying and you don't have to cope on your own.
 
 You might be bullied about your:
 
 * religion
 
 * religious practices, like not eating meat or drinking alcohol
 
 * clothes or symbols, like if you wear a headscarf, cross or kara
 
 * where you were born
 
 * the way you speak or your accent
 
 * class or caste.
 
 Being treated differently because of your religion, lack of religion or your beliefs is a type of discrimination. It's also wrong for someone to treat you unfairly because of your friend or family members' religion.
 
 It's still discrimination if someone doesn't mean to treat you differently or if they make a wrong assumption about you. Discrimination is against the law and you can get help to get it stopped.
 
 5 things to try:
 
 * let friends and teachers know when you take part in religious events so they understand more about you and what you're doing.
 
 * share photos or blogs about religious festivals so other people can see what these are like.
 
 * tell friends about the foods and drinks you're not allowed in your religion so they don't offer you these.
 
 * ask friends why they wear religious items and how they feel about it.
 
 * ask friends if you can join in with their religious events. This can help you understand their religion and culture a bit more.

 If you find new or different things scary you could find positive facts about a culture or religion to help you to see another perspective.
 
 You could ask people questions about their beliefs and explain more about your faith, religion or values. This could be a way of learning about each other and about the things that make us who we are.

 WHAT ARE RACISM AND RACIAL BULLYING?
 
 Racism is where someone thinks you're inferior because of your colour, ethnicity, nationality or race. This can result in them treating you differently or unfairly, this is called racial discrimination. 
 
 Racial bullying is a type of racism where someone's bullying focuses on your race, ethnicity or culture. Racism and racial bullying are wrong and you can get help to make it stop.
 
 Racism and racist bullying can include:
 
 * being called racist names or being sent insulting messages or threats
 
 * having your belongings damaged or having to see racist graffiti
 
 * personal attacks, including violence or assault
 
 * being left out, treated differently or excluded
 
 * people making assumptions about you because of your colour, race or culture
 
 * being made to feel like you have to change how you look
 
 * racist jokes, including jokes about your colour, nationality race or culture.
 
 Racism can affect anyone. It can make you feel like you're not important or don't fit in. You might feel upset, depressed or angry. You can be affected by it even when it's not aimed at you, like if you hear someone discriminating against someone's culture.
 
 No matter how racism makes you feel, we're here to support you.
 
 4 things to remember
 
 1. It's illegal to treat someone differently or unfairly because of their race.
 
 2. Racism and racial bullying is wrong, even if the person doesn't realise they're doing it.
 
 3. If someone commits a crime against you because of your race, religion or culture that is a hate crime.
 
 4. You're not alone, and there are ways to get support.
 
 Understand Me
 
 It can be hard to talk when you're being judged on your race, religion or culture. But we're here to support you.
 
 BEING TARGETED BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUS
 
 Some young people have told us that they or their families are being hurt, bullied or even attacked for having an East Asian and South East Asian background. Remember that this is racism, it's wrong and could be considered a hate crime. If it's happening to you, we're here to help.
 
 There are things you can do if you're worried:
 
 * Talk to someone you trust, like a teacher, your family or a Childline counsellor
 
 * Block people who say things online, and report online bullying
 
 * If you're feeling unsafe outside, go somewhere public with other people around
 
 * Make a report to the police if someone hurts or threatens you.
 
 Childline is here to support you with anything that might be happening.
 
 WHAT YOU CAN DO
 
 If someone is calling you names, making you feel scared or treating you unfairly, you can get help to make this stop.
 
 * Walk away. If someone is being racist towards you right now, walk away to keep safe and don't retaliate or respond.
 
 * Tell someone what's happening. This could be your teacher, sports coach or your manager at work. Remember you can always ask to speak to someone's manager about racism, wherever you are.
 
 * Keep safe. Walk home from school or college with someone you know and keep your phone charged. Calling emergency services on 999?or Childline on 0800 1111 are both free calls.
 
 * Stay safe online. Change your privacy settings, report abuse on the site or app and block users who bully you or make discriminatory comments or threats.
 
 * Keep a record. Messages, videos or a diary of what's been happening can help when telling an adult or be used as evidence.
 
 * Keep telling. You may have to speak out more than once about racism or racial bullying. It's okay to tell someone else if you don't feel it's being taken seriously.
 
 * Find someone who will help. It can take time for bullying to stop. If you feel like a teacher doesn't want to help, you can speak to the head teacher. Each school should have an anti-bullying policy which is there to protect you. If your school doesn't help, you can tell the police.
 
 * Tell the police. If you feel threatened or a crime has been committed, you can report to the police on 999 in an emergency or 101 at other times.

 WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE RACIST?
 
 Our views and beliefs develop as we grow up and are influenced by friends and family, neighbourhoods, school and what we see and read in the media.
 
 People who grow up in a family where racist views are expressed, or have friends who make racist jokes, might learn to believe that racism is normal and acceptable. Especially if they haven't had the chance to interact with people from other cultures or backgrounds.
 
 Racism can sometimes begin as a reaction to world events or news stories. At other times, someone who has had a painful personal experience with someone from a particular racial group might blame everyone of that race.
 
 Everyone makes assumptions. This can happen when they don't have the opportunity to learn about alternative views.
 
 It's never okay to discriminate someone based on their race. If you're worried about how your views might affect other people, it can help to imagine being someone else to try and see their points of view.
 
 SPEAKING OUT ABOUT RACISM
 
 There are things that you can do to speak out about racism and racial bullying.
 
 Treat people fairly and with respect
 
 * We all make assumptions so try to notice any that you make and treat everyone as an individual
 
 * Don't go along with racist jokes. This can make it seem like racist jokes are ok. Racist jokes are a form of abuse and can be hurtful even if people don't show that they're upset at the time
 
 * Walk away if you're around someone being racist. Or if it's safe, tell them that you don't agree in a calm and assertive way.
 
 Learn about other cultures and nationalities
 
 * You could read interviews and blogs or watch vlogs by people who are different from you.
 
 * Welcome and include anyone who's being excluded. You could start or support a mentoring scheme at school, college or in your community.
 
 * If your friends feel comfortable talking about it, ask about their culture or background to learn more.
 
 Raise awareness about racism and racial bullying
 
 * Get involved in assemblies and campaigns and educate others about the effects of racism.
 
 * Talk about your experiences when you feel safe and supported, like in a PHSE lesson, during circle time or on the message boards.
 
 Talk about your feelings
 
 * If you experience, see or hear something offensive talk to someone you trust like your friends, family or a teacher. Or you can speak to a Childline counsellor.

 WHAT IS EMOTIONAL ABUSE?

 * calls you names
 
 * keeps shouting at you, even if you haven't done anything wrong
 
 * puts you down 
 
 * ignores you or leaves you out of things
 
 * says or does things that make you feel bad about yourself
 
 * makes you feel like you don't belong

 * tries to control you or put pressure on you to do things you're not ready to do
 
 * treats you differently from your brothers or sisters
 
 * puts you in dangerous situations
 
 * is aggressive and violent to other people in your family and you keep seeing it

 There are lots of different reasons why a person might abuse you emotionally.
 
 They might be taking their own stress out on you. Or they might feel a need to control other people, especially if they're struggling to control their own life.
 
 Only the person doing this would know why they're behaving in this way. But whatever their reasons, it's not okay. And it's not your fault.

 WHAT YOU CAN DO
 
 Sometimes young people who talk to Childline don't realise that what has happened to them is emotional abuse and that it's wrong. This can be because they're used to being treated in this way. It can seem normal to them. But you deserve to be treated with care and respect.
 
 Tell someone
 
 If you are being emotionally abused you don't have to deal with it alone. It can help to tell someone about what's happening.
 
 It can be a big step to tell someone what's happening, and to explain why someone is making you feel bad. But remember Childline is here to listen to you. Our counsellors will never judge you. They will listen and support you.
 
 Keep a diary of what's happening
 
 You could also keep a diary of the emotional abuse, recording what has happened and when. Show this to an adult you trust. This could be a family member, a friend or someone at school like a teacher or counsellor. Keeping a diary can help you get your thoughts in order and decide what you want to say. It's also a good way of showing other people what's been happening to you and help them realise that it's wrong. Sign up to track your mood in your locker.
 
 Write it in a letter
 
 If it's too difficult to tell someone in person you might find it easier to write a letter about what is happening to an adult you trust. If you feel like it you can email it to a Childline counsellor. Writing can help you think clearly about what's happening - and it could help you see that emotional abuse is wrong.

 Social services (also called children's services) are people who work for the government by making sure families have the things they need. If you're thinking about contacting them, a Childline counsellor can talk to you about what you would like to happen. They can support you with making the decision and in certain situations Childline can contact social services on your behalf.
 
 Worried about a friend
 
 Many families argue, but if your friend is often scared or depressed or feeling sad because of the way somebody treats them, this could be abuse. The best thing to do is talk to your friend and suggest that they contact Childline or talk to an adult they trust. If that doesn't work you could talk to a Childline counsellor yourself. You can also look at our page about helping a friend.

118,1,"PHYSICAL ABUSE
 
 If someone deliberately hurts or injures you or another person, it's physical abuse. You might be told that it's your fault, or that they're punishing you. But nothing makes it okay for someone to hurt you. Abuse is never your fault.

 WHAT IS PHYSICAL ABUSE?
 
 Physical abuse is when someone is hurting you. This could be hurting you with their hands, their feet, or an object. Some examples of physical abuse are:
 
 * hitting, smacking and slapping
 
 * punching and kicking
 
 * pinching, scratching and biting
 
 * shaking or suffocating you
 
 * scalding or burning you
 
 * hair pulling
 
 * spitting or throwing things at you
 
 * making you swallow something that hurts or makes you feel ill, including giving you medicine when you're not ill or don't need it.
 
 5 things to remember:
 
 * no matter what the reason, physical abuse is always wrong
 
 * being abused is not your fault
 
 * it might feel like telling someone could make it worse, but getting help can keep you safe
 
 * physical abuse can make you feel powerless. Being hurt is never your fault and our counsellors are always here to help
 
 * if you're in immediate danger, you can call the police on 999 and they will come to help you.

 HOW PHYSICAL ABUSE AFFECTS YOU
 
 Physical abuse can leave you with more than marks on your body. It can lead to you feeling:
 
 * frightened or anxious
 
 * depressed and sad
 
 * lonely and isolated
 
 * like you want to self-harm or run away
 
 * angry
 
 * worthless or like you have no self-esteem
 
 * unable to eat normally
 
 * unable to sleep properly
 
 * numb or like you've been cut off from your feelings
 
 * unable to concentrate at school or college
 
 * guilty and worried that it is you fault - even though it isn't
 
 These feelings can last long after your injuries have healed. And this can stop you living your life and enjoying yourself. But you can get help and support.

 WHY AM I BEING PHYSICALLY ABUSED?
 
 This is a difficult question to answer. People who physically abuse others may give different reasons for hurting someone. Sometimes, they might be struggling with different issues. And certain things might trigger abusive behaviour, like alcohol or drug use.
 
 But this is never an excuse. No matter what someone is going through, it doesn't make it okay for them to hurt you.
 
 Physical abuse can happen alongside other types of abuse, like sexual abuse, emotional abuse or domestic violence.
 
 TELLING SOMEONE HELPS
 
 Talking about abuse is difficult. But it helps. Telling someone what's going on means you don't have to deal with it on your own. Most importantly, telling someone can help stop the physical abuse. It also means you can start to live a life that's happier and safer.
 
 How to tell someone
 
 When you're ready to tell someone, it might help to write down what you want to say first or put it in a letter. Try and choose a person you feel comfortable with and who you think you can trust. If the abuse is happening at home, you might want to talk to somebody outside of the family such as a teacher or doctor. Find out more about asking an adult for help.
 
 If you prefer, you can always talk to a Childline counsellor. They won't rush you into saying anything you don't want to. They will listen and help you decide what the best option might be. Contact a counsellor by phone on 0800 1111 or talk to us online.
 
 Telling someone is the right thing to do
 
 You might feel like you still like or love the person who's abusing you, even though you don't like what they're doing. Especially if the person is your mum or dad. The abuse might also only happen at certain times, such as when they've been drinking.
 
 But physical abuse is always wrong. And telling someone often helps the situation get better.
 
 What happens next
 
 Physical abuse is wrong and against the law. If it keeps on happening, it can affect your future happiness, so it needs to stop.
 
 What happens next depends on who you speak to and exactly what's happening at home. Remember that you can always talk to one of our counsellors about what can happen next. You can ask us confidentially what the next steps are and how you can get support.
 
 Getting help if you've been hurt
 
 It can be scary asking for help if you've been hurt or injured. But it's important to keep you safe.
 
 In an emergency, you should always call 999. You can get medical support in lots of ways, by:
 
 * visiting your doctor
 
 * talking to your school nurse
 
 * telling an adult you trust what's happened 
 
 * going to your local A&E department.
 
 Childline counsellors aren't medically trained, but if you're worried you might be hurt and you're not sure what to do they can support you to get the right help.
 
 Worried about a friend being physically abused?
 
 Physical abuse affects people in different ways. Sometimes they might have obvious signs such as bruises or cuts, but these signs could also be hidden under clothes. They might be unusually quiet and withdrawn, or they might lash out and become angry, stressed or violent. 
 
 If you're worried about a family member or friend being physically abused, it can really help to let them know you're there to help them. Even just listening to what's going on for them can make a big difference. 
 
 It's also a very good idea to get them to talk to a counsellor for support, You can also get advice about helping a friend.

 WHY SEXUAL ABUSE CAN HAPPEN
 
 It's normal to want to know why it can or has happened. It's nothing to do with who you are, or what you've said or done. Some people want to feel power and control.
 
 They know what they're doing is wrong. They might tell you to keep it a secret or try and make you believe that it's okay. This is called 'grooming' which is a way to build up trust with you so they can keep abusing you. Grooming also happens online.

 HOW TO TELL SOMEONE YOU'VE BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED
 
 If you've been sexually abused and you're not sure how to bring it up with someone who could help, try these steps;
 
 * Pick somebody you trust
 
 Speaking up about sexual abuse is a brave and difficult thing to do. They could be a grandparent, neighbour, a friend's parent, teacher, religious leader or doctor. Find out more about asking an adult for help.
 
 * Write it down
 
 Talking about abuse can be upsetting but it's important that you tell them as much as you can about what's been happening - you could try writing it down in a letter instead.
 
 * Pick a time
 
 When you can talk privately with the person you want to tell.
 
 * Get support
 
 If you have a close friend, you could ask them to be there when you tell somebody.
 
 * Understand that it's NOT your fault
 
 You may feel ashamed or embarrassed. But you shouldn't be. And you shouldn't let that stop you talking to someone you trust.
 
 * Know that Childline is always here for you
 
 You can contact us on 0800 1111 and online.
 
 Sexual abuse is one of the hardest things to talk about. It can make you feel afraid, isolated or ashamed. But it's never your fault and it's never too late to tell someone. There are people who can help you. If you're finding it hard to talk about what happened, you can try expressing yourself using our Art box.

 Katie shares her story of sexual abuse from her step-father and boyfriend.
 
 WHAT YOU CAN DO
 
 Sexual abuse is wrong. It doesn't matter how many times it happened, how long ago, or whether they were male or female, it's still important that you get the help and support you need. It's never too late to tell somebody.
 
 If it's happening to you, we can help. Call us on 0800 1111, or talk online on our 1-2-1 counsellor chat. If you call us you could say ""somebody is making me do something which I don't like."" You don't need to say who it is. The counsellor will want to understand what's been happening for you and they might ask some questions. But it's okay to say you don't want to answer any questions you're not comfortable with.
 
 Collect things that could be used as proof
 
 Even if you think that you don't have any evidence, it's still important that you tell somebody. If you can, save any texts, emails or messages from the person who is abusing you and the times it happened. But remember, if you don't have evidence, you can still ask for help
 
 Never give up
 
 Some people may find it upsetting to be told about something as serious as sexual abuse and may find it difficult to come to terms with what you are saying. They may not want to get involved or might suggest that you're overreacting or that you've got it wrong. All this doesn't mean that you shouldn't tell people. If you speak to someone who doesn't want to help you, don't give up - tell somebody else. You have done the right thing in speaking up.
 
 Remember you're not alone
 
 It's normal to feel worried about:
 
 * what people might think
 
 * upsetting a parent or carer
 
 * making the abuse worse for yourself or a brother or sister
 
 * getting the person who's abusing you into trouble
 
 * breaking up the family
 
 The most important thing is that you are safe and you feel like you can talk to somebody. You shouldn't have to go through this on your own.
 
 Reporting the abuse to a teacher, police officer or doctor
 
 There are a few things to remember if you tell a professional. They have a duty to report it to a social worker:
 
 * a social worker's job is to talk with you and your family to see how to keep you safe is. If they can, they will always try and sort things out in the family before they think about moving anyone out of the house
 
 * depending on the information they have and whether they know of your family already, a social worker may do a 'safety check' within 7 days. This usually means a social worker coming round to speak to you and your parent or carer
 
 * if the abuse is happening at home, you can tell a teacher that you're afraid and would prefer to speak to a social worker at school instead
 
 * if you have any evidence then it's a good idea to give them that too. If you do decide to tell someone you can still talk to us about what is happening for you.
 
 What to do if you're worried about a friend
 
 If you think your friend might be being abused, talk to them about it. You can let them know that you are there for them to talk if they want to. Remember that they may not want to talk to you about it. They may be scared about what will happen if they tell someone.
 
 If they do tell you about what's happening to them, you could encourage them to tell a trusted adult about it. Let them know that you are there for them and they can talk to you. You and your friend can also talk to a counsellor at any time. It could help to sit with your friend and have a look at our website, so they can see what we do and how we can help.
 
 It can be very difficult hearing that a friend has been abused, but we can support you through this. Contact a counsellor.

 WHAT IS RAPE? (WARNING - EXPLICIT LANGUAGE)
 
 Rape is when someone forces their penis into another person's vagina, mouth or anus (bottom) without consent. This can happen to any gender, including boys and girls.
 
 Rape is against the law. If you're not sure whether it's happened, you can get support.
 
 When 2 people have sex, it's really important that they both give their consent. This means that they both want to have sex, and both agree to it. And they both have the right to change their mind at any time. You can say 'no' even if you've had sex with that person before.
 
 Rape can happen in a relationship. If you're in a relationship, you both need to agree to have sex. Being forced to have sex is rape, whether it is with your partner, family, friend or somebody else.
 
 What happens when I tell the police?
 
 If you talk to the police they have to take you seriously. Every situation is different. But talking to them means there is a chance that the person who raped you could be caught and possibly sent to prison.
 
 If you have been raped recently, the police will often start with collecting some evidence. This usually involves taking swabs or samples from your clothing. Even if the rape happened a while ago, they will want to support you.
 
 The police will also ask for a statement about what happened. Even if you feel embarrassed about some parts or can't remember, it's important to tell them as much as possible.
 
 It's a really good idea to ask a friend or an adult you trust to come with you to talk to the police so they can support you. It's also okay to ask for a male or female police officer, if you would feel more comfortable with someone who is the same sex as you. 
 
 Why didn't I try to stop it?
 
 If you were raped by somebody you know and trust, they might have made you think that it was okay. This can be called grooming - when somebody forms a friendship with you and then slowly starts to control you. They might have said that you agreed to it or that it's your fault. If this has happened, it was not your fault no matter what they have told you. You trusted them and they have taken advantage of that trust. Sometimes grooming can happen online too - find out more.
 
 Some people use violence and threats which can cause you to freeze up in fear. Rape is a really scary and shocking experience which can make it impossible to fight back.
 
 What if I felt some pleasure?
 
 It's natural for your body to react to sexual touching. It is the way our bodies are designed and some feelings can happen even if you don't want them to. It doesn't mean that you enjoyed it or it was your fault. It is just a normal reaction. And it can happen to both girls and boys. Experiencing pleasure during rape could be a confusing thing to deal with. But remember that you have done nothing wrong.
 
 I was drinking or taking drugs when it happened. Is it my fault?
 
 No. it wasn't your fault. Drugs and alcohol can make it harder to say no. Rape is never okay.
 
 Drugs and alcohol can leave you feeling confused about what's happening, and your judgement can be affected. You might not feel as strong or able to get away from someone trying to hurt or rape you.
 
 Taking drugs or drinking alcohol doesn't  mean that you 'asked for it' or 'deserved it'. What they did was very wrong, no matter what the situation was.
 
 I can't remember what happened. What can I do?
 
 If you think you or a friend has been drugged, it's important that you get medical help straight away. You can talk to  NHS 111  by calling 111. They can help you and give you advice on what to do next. Or you can call 999 for urgent help.
 
 A nurse can do a urine test to see what type of drug (if any) was used and make sure that you're okay. If you have been drugged, they may advise you to tell the police so they can be aware of it and help prevent it from happening to somebody else. Read more about seeing your doctor.
 
 It's scary telling somebody that you think you've been raped. But it's not your fault. And support is available. Telling someone is often the first step to feeling better and getting help with the situation.
 
 How can I help a friend?
 
 Your friend is likely to feel very scared and confused. The best thing you can do is to talk to them and let them know that you are there for them.
 
 Try and encourage them to tell a trusted adult about it. This could be a teacher, nurse, your mum or dad or one of our counsellors. Find out more about helping a friend.
 
 WHAT IS  SEXUAL ASSAULT? (WARNING - EXPLICIT LANGUAGE)
 
 Sexual assault is when somebody intentionally touches you in a sexual way without your consent (permission). For example, if a friend's brother forces their hand onto your private parts when you don't want them to - this would be sexual assault.
 
 If somebody forces their fingers or an object inside of you (either your vagina or bottom) this is also assault. Both girls and boys could be sexually assaulted by either males or females.
 
 HOW RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL
 
 It's normal for rape or sexual assault to lead to different feelings and emotions. You could be feeling:
 
 Shocked: You might feel 'numb' or surprisingly calm about what happened. You might feel shocked and like you can't understand what happened.
 
 Embarrassed: You might be worried about what people will think and how you will tell them. Read about embarrassment.
 
 Guilty: You might think that it was your fault - even though this isn't true. You could be angry at yourself for not stopping it. But you shouldn't be angry at yourself.
 
 Scared: You might have flashbacks or nightmares and feel frightened about being alone. This is a natural reaction. And it's likely that this will get better over time.
 
 Angry: You might want to hurt the person responsible. You may also feel like this towards yourself - even though it wasn't your fault.
 
 Depressed: You could feel hopeless or sad - like you don't have anything to look forward to anymore.

 GETTING SUPPORT WITH STIS AND PREGNANCY
 
 It's not always easy to tell whether you've caught a sexually transmitted infection (STI) from someone, but it's important to get help if you have been sexually assaulted.
 
 Your doctor?or a sexual assault referral centre can give you confidential support with what's happened and can test you for STIs. If you're worried. It can be difficult to think about, but if you think there's a chance you might be pregnant, they can support you.
 
 Getting medical support doesn't mean that you have to report what's happened, and you can ask about confidentiality before you say anything.

 STAYING SAFE FROM DATE RAPE DRUGS
 
 If you take one (or someone makes you take one) they can make you feel dizzy, confused and helpless. This means someone can take advantage of you and make you do things you don't want to do.
 
 Date rape drugs don't smell or taste of anything, so they could be given to you without you realising it. Someone could put it in your drink without you knowing. That's why it's really important to make sure you don't leave your drink out of your sight at a party, club or gig. It's also much safer to make sure you don't let a stranger or someone you hardly know buy you a drink. 
 
 If you're out or at a party:
 
 DO
 
 * keep your drinks with you at all times, even if you go to the bathroom
 
 * buy and open your own drinks
 
 * buy bottled drinks so you can keep your thumb over the rim in crowded areas
 
 * go to parties with people you trust
 
 * arrange how you will get back before you go out and let people know your plans.
 
 DON'T
 
 * take drugs if somebody offers them to you. They can have the same effect as the date rape drug and can make you extremely vulnerable
 
 * let strangers buy you drinks
 
 * let people pass you drinks to share or share drinks with others
 
 * don't drink from punch bowls (or 'fish bowls') that lots of strangers are sharing.

 WHAT NEGLECT MEANS
 
 There's a difference between things we want and things we need. Some people might want a new games console. Or a new phone.
 
 But these aren't things you need. You need things like enough to eat and drink. And protection from danger. And clean clothes. Your parents or carers should make sure you have these things.
 
 You also shouldn't have to spend a lot of time looking after other people in your family without getting any support from an adult.
 
 If you have a disability you should also be supported in whatever extra ways you need.
 
 Every young person needs:
 
 * clothes that are clean and warm and shoes that fit and keep you dry
 
 * enough to eat and drink
 
 * protection from dangerous situations
 
 * somewhere warm, dry and comfortable to sleep
 
 * help when you're ill or you've been hurt
 
 * love and care from your parents or carers
 
 * support with your education
 
 * access and help with medication if needed.

 REASONS FOR NEGLECT
 
 There could be lots of reasons why you are being neglected. Your family may be doing their best. But they might just not have enough money. Maybe someone who looks after you has a problem with alcohol or drugs. Or maybe they are having problems with their physical or mental health.
 
 Whatever is happening is not your fault and you can get help.
 
 SPEAKING OUT ABOUT NEGLECT
 
 If any of this is happening to you, it's important to tell someone. You might think it's your fault. But it isn't. Every child and young person has the right to be looked after properly. Sometimes parents and carers can't manage this by themselves.
 
 How to tell someone
 
 You could start by talking to a counsellor. You can talk to them confidentially and let them know what's going on.
 
 You might feel anxious and worried about what other people will think. You might have seen other young people at school who always seem to get whatever they need. It can feel embarrassing if you are not getting the things you need. It's really important to remember that you are not to blame for what is happening to you.
 
 Telling someone like social services
 
 Your parents or carers need to make sure you're looked after properly, even if sometimes they can't do it. Speaking to someone about being neglected doesn't mean that you'll automatically be taken into care. The police and social services are there to protect you from being neglected and are there to help families with whatever problems they are having. They will only arrange for you to spend time in care if they think it's too dangerous for you to live at home. 
 
 Sometimes social services might want brothers and sisters to live in different places so they can make sure each child is looked after properly. They can't promise that you will all stay in the same place but they will always try to keep a family together in their home as long as it is safe to do this.
 
 A first step to your family getting help is to talk to someone you trust such as a teacher or a friend's parent and tell them what is happening. Often it can help if someone from outside your family looks to see where support is needed. 
 
 If you feel that you don't want to talk to anyone you know about what's happening or are too scared, you can always talk to a Childline counsellor.
 
 What do I do if things get worse?
 
 If a family gets support and can make some changes, things will often get better and everyone feels less worried. Some parents and carers can find it hard to keep the changes going. Sometimes things might start to get worse again after a while.
 
 If this happens to you, remember that you got help before and you can get it again. It's really important to let people know what is going on. Neglect should never happen, however long it goes on for. If you think you might be experiencing neglect, it's important to speak to someone who can help. You can always call Childline on 0800 1111 or contact us online.

 We've got advice to help you cope if you're feeling unsafe staying at home.
 
 HOW CAN I TELL IF SOMEONE I KNOW IS BEING NEGLECTED?
 
 If you think a friend is being neglected, there are things you can do to help them. But it's not always clear if someone's experiencing neglect or not. If you're worried about someone, you could see if you notice any of these things:
 
 * they seem like they haven't washed, are dirty or smelly, or their clothes seem dirty
 
 * they are hungry or asking for other people's food
 
 * they often come to school with no lunch money or packed lunch
 
 * their parents don't seem to know where they are or what they are doing
 
 * they often don't turn up for school, or they often arrive late
 
 * they don't seem to have many friends
 
 * they get sent to school even when they are really unwell
 
 It can be hard to decide how to support your friend if you notice any of these things. Maybe you could start by talking to an adult that you trust.
 
 If you don't feel comfortable asking your friend about it you can always talk to a Childline counsellor. You could also look at our page on helping a friend for more ideas on how you could support them.
 
 If you're not getting what you need at home you might be experiencing neglect.

 AM I BEING NEGLECTED?
 
 It can be hard to work out if you're being neglected. Sometimes parents may not even realise they're neglecting their children. If you're worried about anything to do with neglect, you can contact Childline for a chat with a counsellor any time. 
 
 I have to help someone in my family
 
 A young carer is a young person who helps look after someone in their family who has a disability or illness (including mental health problems) or a drug or alcohol problem. If you're a young carer, you should still have enough free time to do your school work, see friends or just chill out for a bit.
 
 Being a young carer shouldn't lead to being neglected. As a young carer you should still have access to all the things young people need, like food, clean clothes, love and care.
 
 Social services are there to help you and the person you are caring for so you don't end up struggling. If it feels like you are not getting enough support, it's a good idea to ask for help. You can always talk to Childline about anything that's worrying you.
 
 My parents don't spend time with me
 
 This can sometimes be emotional neglect, especially if you don't get to see your parents or carers often. If they don't seem to notice changes in your life or times when you are hurt or ill, or show affection towards you such as hugging, you could be being emotionally neglected.
 
 This kind of neglect is a form of emotional abuse. Neglect can sometimes happen at the same time as other types of abuse.  If your parents or carers do not spend much time with you, say things to put you down, threaten or shout at you a lot, this could be abuse even if you do have enough food, clothes and a place to sleep. You can speak to a counsellor and talk through what you're experiencing.

 FGM: Hadas' story
 
 Hadas experienced female genital mutilation (FGM) and wants this practice to stop.
 
 NEED TO TALK? TRY OUR 1-2-1 COUNSELLOR CHAT.
 
 WHAT IS FGM?
 
 FGM, sometimes referred to as female circumcision, is when a girl's genitals (private parts) are altered or removed. It can cause long-lasting damage as well as ongoing emotional distress.
 
 The operation is usually done by someone who doesn't have any medical training. Girls are given no anaesthetic, no antiseptic treatment and are often forced to keep still.
 
 The cutting is made using tools such as a knife, pair of scissors, scalpel, glass or razor blade.
 
 FGM can be extremely painful and dangerous. It can cause:
 
 * really bad pain
 
 * shock
 
 * bleeding
 
 * infections such as tetanus, HIV and hepatitis B and C
 
 * organ damage.
 
 It can also cause problems later on. You may experience difficulties in childbirth, or need medical treatment. Blood loss and infections can cause death in some cases.
 
 FGM can also cause emotional distress at the time and in the future, and it might lead to anxiety and depression.
 
 5 facts about FGM:
 
 * FGM is abuse, and it's illegal in the UK
 
 * there is no religious or medical reason for FGM
 
 * FGM can happen at any age before marriage
 
 * FGM can be dangerous if there is blood loss and infection
 
 * if you've been cut or you're worried about FGM, help is available.
 
 If you're worried, our counsellors are always here to support you. But if things are feeling really scary or you need help right away, you can call 999 for immediate support.

 You might worry that:
 
 * your family or parents will get in trouble or be upset
 
 * you won't be able to get married
 
 * you will get other people into trouble, or everyone you know will turn against you.
 
 It's normal to feel this way and it's okay to have these feelings. It's not unusual to have a good relationship with the person that wants you to be cut, but feel upset that they want this to happen. It could make you worry. Or feel stressed or angry.
 
 Remember, FGM is abuse and is illegal and you have the right to speak out and stay safe. You don't have to go through this alone. Childline is always here for you.
 
 If you're going abroad, you can take this statement opposing female genital mutilation with you.
 
 You can show it to your family so they know FGM is a serious criminal offence. Put it in your passport and keep it with you all the time.
 
 What is the NSPCC FGM helpline?
 
 Childline is part of the NSPCC and we work together to help young people.
 
 NSPCC wants to make sure you get support if you or someone you know is worried about FGM so they've got a helpline just for these kinds of worries.
 
 You can contact the NSPCC helpline by emailing fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk or calling free on 0800 028 3550
 
 If you're abroad you can call +44 800 028 3550 but check call charges first.
 
 HOW TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE
 
 Worried a friend could be affected by FGM?
 
 If you're worried a friend or family member might have been cut, you could try to talk to them about it. It would be good to do it in private, when there's enough time to chat properly. 
 
 It would be helpful to suggest they contact Childline or talk to an adult they trust or contact the NSPCC FGM helpline by emailing fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk or calling free on 0800 028 3550.
 
 You could also think about telling someone what's happening. It's a lot to cope with on your own and an adult should be able to help you get support. You could talk to a trusted adult, like a teacher, a youth worker or a doctor.
 
 Signs of FGM
 
 After someone has experienced FGM, they might feel isolated and like nobody will understand. Often they're told not to tell anyone and there can be a lot of pressure to act normal. If someone has experienced FGM, they don't have to keep it to themselves.
 
 A girl or woman might:
 
 * have difficulty walking, sitting or standing
 
 * spend longer than normal in the bathroom or toilet
 
 * seem different after being away from school or college
 
 * not want to go to see their doctor for a check-up
 
 * ask for help or be in pain but not tell you exactly what the problem is
 
 * be tearful and struggle to concentrate.
 
 You can always talk to Childline. We can help you think about how to support your friend.

 WHAT IS BREAST FLATTENING?
 
 Breast flattening (sometimes known as breast ironing) is when a girl's breasts are pressed with a hot object, massaged, pounded or flattened over time to flatten them and delay their development.
 
 This is different from choosing to bind your breasts - we have lots more information and advice about gender identity and how to cope with how you're feeling.
 
 Breast flattening is often done by a female family member, like a mother, aunty or grandmother, who believe this will help keep the girl safe from unwanted attention from men. Whatever the reason - breast flattening is abuse and it's wrong. It can be very painful and cause health issues.
 
 How does breast flattening work?
 
 There are different objects used for breast flattening, including:
 
 * grinding stone
 
 * pestle
 
 * spatula
 
 * wooden spoon
 
 * broom.
 
 Sometimes these objects are heated first (this is often called breast ironing). Breast flattening can also involve using belts or binders to press the breasts down.
 
 If you are at all worried than you can always speak to one of our counsellors. If you feel in immediate danger you can always call the police on 999.

 I'M WORRIED BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN IF I SPEAK UP
 
 You may be worried if you speak up about breast flattening that:
 
 * your family would get in to trouble or be upset
 
 * your family will turn against you
 
 * you or your family will be judged.
 
 It's normal to feel like this and it can make speaking up feel really hard. You might have a good relationship with the person doing this to you and they might believe they're doing this for your own good. However, breast flattening is harmful and nobody should be hurting you like this.
 
 You don't have to go through this experience alone. You can speak to our counsellors confidentially any time.
 
 WORRIED ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE
 
 If you're worried someone you know is experiencing breast flattening you can try to talk to them in private about it. You can encourage them to talk to Childline or a safe adult like a teacher.
 
 Helping a friend?through a tough time is hard - and it's important you take care of yourself and how you're feeling too. Try talking to Childline or a safe adult about how you are feeling - they might have advice to help you and the person you're worried about.
 
 Signs that someone is going through breast flattening
 
 If someone is going through breast flattening they might:
 
 * talk about pain or discomfort in the chest area
 
 * be embarrassed about their body
 
 * be afraid to get changed for sports as they want to hide their scars or bandages
 
 * tell you that it is happening to them, but don't understand that it is harmful.

 If you've been affected by child trafficking and exploitation, or are worried about someone else, there are ways to get help and support. You don't have to cope alone.

 WHAT IS CHILD TRAFFICKING?
 
 Child trafficking is when young people are tricked, forced or persuaded to leave their homes and are moved and then exploited, forced to work or sold. Child trafficking and exploitation are types of child abuse.
 
 Children and young people can be trafficked into the UK from other countries, and also within the UK. They could be moved to a different country or even within the same town or village. Traffickers could work alone, be part of a small group or a large organised group.
 
 If you've experienced child trafficking and are being exploited it can be really hard to recognise what's happening. You may feel trapped and like you have to do something you're uncomfortable with or don't want to do. 
 
 Facts about child traffickers
 
 Traffickers might:
 
 * try to befriend you online or in person
 
 * be someone who's befriended your family
 
 * be a family member
 
 * threaten you or your family or claim you owe them a debt
 
 * promise you or your family a better life elsewhere.
 
 CHILD EXPLOITATION
 
 Young people are trafficked so that they can be exploited. Child exploitation is when you are forced or tricked into doing something you don't want to do for someone else's benefit.  Exploitation and trafficking involve many types of abuse and neglect.
 
 Some of the things you could be forced to do are:
 
 * have sex or perform sexual acts - this is called sexual exploitation
 
 * work (for example in a factory, restaurant or someone's house)
 
 * beg, steal or commit crime
 
 * grow, carry or deal drugs
 
 * sell your organs
 
 * force you to marry someone.
 
 Signs of exploitation
 
 Some of the ways someone who's exploiting you might force you to do something include:
 
 * giving you nice things and then telling you that you owe them
 
 * organising for you to be robbed of a drugs package and then telling you that you owe them
 
 * having control of your ID documents or money
 
 * blackmailing you because they have sexual videos or pictures of you
 
 * threatening you or your family.

 No one has the right to force you into marriage. If you're having problems with your family, we're here to help.

 SUPPORT FOR CHILD TRAFFICKING AND EXPLOITATION
 
 If you've experienced child trafficking or exploitation, you may have mixed feelings about the person who's exploiting you. It can feel confusing because on the one hand they're making you do things that you don't want to do, but they could also be really nice to you, give you nice things and be there when you need them.
 
 Traffickers and others who exploit young people are very skilful at becoming your friend and building a relationship with you so that they can exploit you. This is called grooming. They then make you feel like you have to do things that you don't want to. And often use physical, sexual or emotional abuse to control you. Nobody should be making you feel like this. No one has the right to manipulate you into doing things you're uncomfortable with.
 
 You could feel ashamed of the things you've experienced or been forced to do, but none of these are your fault. They are entirely the fault of the person who exploited you.
 
 It can feel difficult to get out of a situation where you're being exploited, but there is always help available. You don't have to go through it alone.
 
 How to get help
 
 * Runaway Helpline: They can listen and offer confidential support if you have been forced to leave home. You can call or text them 24/7 on 116 000.
 
 * Modern Slavery Helpline: You can speak to an advisor who can help you access relevant services. You can call them 24/7 on 08000 121 700. You can also report what's happening on their online form and their app.
 
 * Fearless: You can report crimes and how you are being exploited 100% anonymously through their online form.
 
 * You can also contact Childline, we are here to listen and support you with anything you may be going through.
 
 WORRIED ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE
 
 If you're worried someone you know is experiencing or could be at risk of child trafficking or exploitation, it's important to know what to look out for. Signs that this might be happening include:
 
 * their behaviour has changed, they could be more aggressive or more withdrawn.
 
 * they're wearing the same clothes as the day before
 
 * their appearance has changed and they may look run down or like they haven't washed
 
 * they're travelling a lot
 
 * you're seeing less of them
 
 * they're anxious to respond to phone messages quickly
 
 * they have new friends that pick them up from school
 
 * they have new gifts like a phone and clothes, and can't explain where they got them
 
 * not having contact with their family or feeling uncomfortable talking about where they live.

 BEING FORCED TO MARRY
 
 Nobody has the right to force you to do something you don't want to do. You can talk to a counsellor any time about how you feel and if you're having problems with your family.
 
 Some families force their children to marry because they:
 
 * think it's an important part of religion or culture
 
 * are worried about the family's reputation and honour (in some cultures also known as 'izzat')
 
 * want all of the family's money to stay together
 
 * want to marry their children off in exchange for money
 
 * don't approve of their child being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender
 
 * don't want their children to have relationships or sex
 
 * feel pressured by the community or other family members to follow traditions
 
 * want to keep family values and honour.
 
 But none of these reasons are okay. And nobody has the right to force you into marriage.
 
 What you need to know about forced marriage:
 
 * it's illegal in the UK
 
 * it's not the same as arranged marriage. In an arranged marriage, people always have a choice about whether they get married or not
 
 * if you think your life's in danger call 999, or if you need support you can talk to a counsellor
 
 * you have the right to choose who you marry, when you marry or whether you want to get married or not.
 
 * there are people who can help.

 WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE BEING FORCED INTO MARRIAGE
 
 Remember that if you're being forced into marrying someone you don't want to, this is wrong and it's also against the law. It can feel like you have no control, but it's important to think about your future, your safety and what a forced marriage would be like for you.
 
 It's possible that your parents or family would force you to marry because they think it's the best thing for you. This doesn't make things okay and you can get help to stop this from happening.
 
 You might love your parents but might also feel unsure about why you're being forced to marry. You might be told that you're bringing shame on your family if you don't marry. Your parents might even say that they'll disown you. This is emotional abuse.
 
 If you can't talk to your parents, maybe you can think of another adult who you trust, like a family member, teacher or school nurse. It's important to let someone know as quickly as possible so that you can be safe and get help.
 
 Forced marriage: Dina's story
 
 Dina was 16 when her family tried to force her into marrying an older man.
 
 YOUR RIGHTS
 
 Forced marriages happen in many religions and nationalities, and can affect both boys and girls. It doesn't only happen to young people, it can happen to adults too. There are some people and communities that think forced marriage is okay.
 
 But it's important to remember that all major religions (Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Christian and Jewish) are against forced marriage. Forced marriage is never okay, and it's important to remember there is help available.
 
 Forced marriage is against the law in the UK and you have a right to say no if you're being made to marry someone who you don't want to. The minimum age for marriage in the UK is 16.
 
 You have the right to:
 
 * choose who you marry, when you marry or whether you want to get married or not
 
 * make decisions and to be able to tell someone about what's happening to you
 
 * feel safe and to ask for help
 
 * say no and explain that you don't feel happy with what is happening.
 
 You might worry that if you tell someone then your parents or other people could get into trouble. Or you may think it will make things worse. You don't have to deal with this on your own. There are people who won't judge you and who will support you with what you're going through. You can contact a counsellor in private at any time and talk about anything.
 
 If you're being taken to another country to get married
 
 If your parents or someone else is taking you to another country to force you to get married, this is wrong. It is also breaking the law. But you can get help.
 
 If you know you are going to be taken out of the country you can contact Childline or the Forced Marriage Unit and explain what is happening.
 
 Get a Forced Marriage Protection Order. The Forced Marriage Unit can help you get this. It's a legal document that can stop you being taken abroad and forced into marriage. It can also help bring you back to the UK if you are taken out of the country. If a court makes an order for you, they will protect you from anyone trying to force you into marriage.
 
 Speak to security staff at the airport if you're already at the airport or travelling. You can speak to airport police officers, or call 999 for urgent help.
 
 Think very carefully before you leave the country. It could be much harder to get help when you are abroad.
 
 Tell someone you trust. Try to let a trusted adult or close friend know that you're being taken away and keep their contact details with you.
 
 Think of a code word that will let someone you trust know you're in danger that only you and they know.
 
 Take information with you like contact details for the Forced Marriage Unit or British Embassy in the country you are visiting in case you need help.
 
 If you're already abroad
 
 You might think you're going on a family holiday but then realise that plans have been made for you to get married. In some cultures, families might plan a holiday around the time of religious festivals.
 
 It can be very scary if you are already abroad and then realise what is happening. You could contact someone who you trust in the UK who could tell your teacher or let the police know. They can tell the Forced Marriage Unit who could help you return. You could also contact the British Embassy in the country where you are - they can get help for you to leave the country and stay safe.
 
 If you worry your parents will disown you if you don't
 
 If your parents have threatened to harm you or to disown you if you don't go ahead with a forced marriage, you can get help. You don't have to cope on your own. There are organisations like the Karma Nirvana and Freedom Charity that support young people who have nowhere to go. They can work with social services to get you help with finding a place to stay. 
 
 Childline is a safe place to talk and the counsellors can help you find the support you need.
 
 IS IT DIFFERENT TO AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE?
 
 A forced marriage is different from an arranged marriage.
 
 Arranged marriage:
 
 * is a cultural tradition
 
 * you have a choice
 
 Forced marriage:
 
 * is an abuse of human rights
 
 * you don't have a choice
 
 Sometimes an arranged marriage can lead to a forced marriage. For example, if you agree to marry someone but then change your mind and decide not to.
 
 If your parents or family don't accept your decision and still make you go ahead with the marriage, this becomes a forced marriage.
 
 If you need support and someone to talk to, you can and speak to one of our counsellors. It's free to call and confidential.

126,1,"DOMESTIC ABUSE
 
 Domestic abuse is when a grown-up threatens, bullies or hurts another adult in the family. Sometimes it's called domestic violence. And it can happen in any family. It can be very hard to deal with but remember that it's never your fault.

 WHAT IS DOMESTIC ABUSE?
 
 It might not always be obvious if what's happening at home is domestic abuse. But if somebody in your family uses bullying or violence to get another adult to do what they want, that's domestic abuse.
 
 It can include:
 
 * Physical violence
 
 Like hitting, kicking, punching, pushing, hair-pulling.
 
 * Threats
 
 This includes threatening to hurt you, another person in your family, or a pet. Or threatening to stop money for food or bills.
 
 * Sexual violence
 
 Making another person do something sexual when they don't want to, or making someone watch sexual material on the internet or television.
 
 * Controlling someone's finances
 
 This includes not allowing somebody to spend their own money. Or not giving them money for basic things such as food, nappies for babies, or clothes.
 
 * Controlling someone's life
 
 This could include stopping someone from going to work or school.
 
 * Cultural or 'honour' violence
 
 This includes being hurt or abused as a punishment for something that's not seen as culturally acceptable by your community or family. It can include being forced to marry someone.
 
 If your boyfriend or girlfriend is under 16 and is being abusive, this is relationship abuse. 
 
 Things you should remember:
 
 * nobody should have to experience domestic abuse in their home 
 
 * if it's happening, it's not your fault
 
 * domestic abuse doesn't always involve physical violence - it can also include bullying and threats
 
 * you can always speak to a counsellor about what's going on
 
 * if you're in danger call 999.

 COPING IF YOU FEEL UNSAFE AT HOME
 
 If you're being abused or made to feel unsafe at home, the schools closing and being told you can't go out can have a big effect on you.
 
 You might be worried about not getting support when you need it, or things getting worse. Your safety is more important than anything.
 
 There are important things you can do when you're feeling unsafe:
 
 Tell someone you feel unsafe
 
 It can be hard to know who to talk to when you're feeling unsafe at home. But Childline is still here to support you when you need us.
 
 You could try talking to an adult you trust, like someone in your family or a friend's parents or carers. It can be hard not to talk in person, but it can help to send a message to tell someone you need to talk. You could also talk to your GP if you're able to.
 
 You can call a Childline counsellor for free on 0800 1111 or speak to a counsellor online using 1-2-1 chat. Our counsellors are here from 7:30am-midnight from Monday to Friday and 9am-midnight at weekends.
 
 It can be scary talking when you're stuck at home. If you don't need to talk straight away, sometimes it can be safer to send a message from your locker. These are read from 7:30am-midnight from Monday-Friday and 9am-midnight at weekends, and we'll usually reply within a day.
 
 In an emergency, you should always call 999.
 
 Avoid unsafe situations
 
 If someone at home is hurting you, it can help to make a plan of how you can stay safe. Sometimes this can mean:
 
 * making sure you're not alone with that person
 
 * avoiding them when they've been drinking or they're angry
 
 * staying in your room or somewhere in the house that feels safe.
 
 If someone's hurting you, it's never your fault. If something's happened and you're not sure if you can stay safe, then you should phone Childline on 0800 1111 or the police on 999.
 
 Make a safety plan
 
 A safety plan can help you know what to do if you feel unsafe at home. It can help to make one if you're worried about being hurt or if you think something might go wrong. A safety plan includes all of the information you'll need in an emergency.
 
 It's important to talk to someone you trust or to Childline when you're making a safety plan.
 
 Your plan could include:
 
 * who to call - this could be an adult you trust, Childline?or the police
 
 * safe places you can stay if you have to leave home, and a plan of how to get there if you need to travel
 
 * things you'll need in an emergency, like medication or a phone charger
 
 * what to do if you're caring for someone else.
 
 Tell the police if you've left home
 
 If something happens and you need to leave home, it's important to talk to the police. While the country is on lockdown, they have the power to take you home, even when you don't want to. Telling them you've left home and that you don't feel safe will help them to support you.
 
 If you've left home, the best way to get support is by phoning the police on 999.
 
 WHY DON'T THEY LEAVE?
 
 Abuse often gets worse over time. By the time somebody decides they no longer want to be in a relationship, it can be very difficult to get out. They might stay because they:
 
 * are too scared to leave
 
 * don't have money or anywhere else to go
 
 * worry about taking their children out of school and moving them
 
 * no longer have the strength to leave
 
 * hope that the abuse will stop.
 
 Whatever the reason, it's not your fault and it's important that you get support.

 HOW IT CAN AFFECT YOUR FAMILY
 
 Even if the abuse at home isn't aimed at you, it doesn't mean you don't get hurt too. If you're in the same or next room when the abuse is going on, it can be extremely upsetting.
 
 It's wrong if you're made to see or hear domestic abuse between adults that look after you.
 
 You might also have been hurt or bullied. And you might be worried about your own safety. Talking about how you feel can really help you to cope.

 MAKING A SAFETY PLAN
 
 If you're experiencing domestic abuse, it's really important to have a safe place that you can go to. And remember, if you or anyone else is ever in danger you should call 999.
 
 1. Make a plan ahead of time
 
 And keep it somewhere safe.
 
 2. Find a safe place
 
 If you have to stay at home, think about where you feel safe.
 
 3. Keep a contact number
 
 Write down the name and contact number of someone you trust if you need someone to call.
 
 4. Get support
 
 Go through your plan with a counsellor. We'll support you to find a way to stop the abuse. Or you can contact Victim Support.
 
 5. Call 999
 
 In an emergency call 999.
 
 GETTING SUPPORT
 
 The most important thing you can do is to keep yourself safe. Domestic abuse isn't your fault. And it's not down to you to stop the fighting, violence or abuse. Trying to stop it could put you in danger.
 
 If you feel it's safe, tell your parents how you feel about what's happening at home. They may not realise that you know what's happening or how scary it is.
 
 Talk to a trusted adult about what's happening. This can really help. If you're worried for your own safety, it's important to talk to somebody as soon as you can.
 
 You can also get support for domestic abuse from The Hide Out.

 WHAT IS DEPRESSION?
 
 People sometimes say they're feeling depressed when they're having a bad day. But depression is a mental health issue that can have a big effect on your life. It's a bit like a physical illness, because people don't choose to have depression.
 
 Depression or feeling low happens to lots of people. Anyone can suffer from depression and it affects people in different ways. A doctor can help you to find out more about depression and how to start feeling better. 
 
 When you're depressed it can seem like people around you don't understand how you're feeling and you might feel alone, but talking to someone can really help you to feel better. And remember our counsellors are always here to listen and support you. 
 
 4 ways to feel better:
 
 1. tell someone how you feel in a letter
 
 2. get tips to boost your confidence if depression's affecting your self-esteem
 
 3. try starting a new hobby, it could be something you always wanted to do. Check our coping kit to get some ideas.
 
 4. remember Childline counsellors are always here for you when you feel down.
 
 WHY DO PEOPLE FEEL SAD OR DEPRESSED?
 
 Depression can happen because of lots of different things, such as:
 
 * bullying
 
 * sexual abuse
 
 * assault or physical abuse
 
 * the death of someone you love
 
 * drug problems
 
 * exam stress
 
 * worries about sexuality.
 
 Sometimes there's no obvious reason for feeling depressed. And going through anything mentioned in the list above doesn't mean you'll definitely develop depression.

 Talk to us about how you're feeling
 
 YOU CAN TALK TO US ABOUT ANYTHING
 
 It can seem like the hardest thing to do, but talking to someone about how you feel means you're starting to deal with your feelings.
 
 If you keep your feelings to yourself, you can start to feel lonely and like you have to cope with everything on your own. Remember that you can always speak to a counsellor for free on 0800 1111 or on a 1-2-1 counsellor chat.
 
 It could also be really helpful to talk to a friend, relative, teacher, parent or carer.
 
 Talk to a doctor
 
 If you think you're depressed, you should talk to your doctor as soon as possible. If you're scared about going on your own, you could ask someone to go with you. Your doctor will be able to find out if you have depression and talk you through the types of treatments that are available. 
 
 Call or talk to a Childline counsellor by calling 0800 1111 for free or via an online 1-2-1 chat. Childline counsellors are here to listen and can put you in touch with other organisations in your area who can support you through difficult times.
 
 If you're dealing with depression or are self-harming, Childline is always here for you to talk to. We can help you find ways of coping.
 
 Getting yourself through it
 
 When you're feeling down, you can sometimes lose the energy to do anything or speak to anyone. But there are things you can do to get through it:
 
 Distract yourself
 
 * exercise or do something that gets you moving
 
 * meet up with friends
 
 * do something creative like drawing, writing or making music
 
 * listen to your favourite music.
 
 Improve your lifestyle
 
 * eat healthily - avoiding sugar and salt can make you feel more energised
 
 * avoid going to bed late - being tired can make everything feel worse
 
 * give yourself positive affirmations - try writing down the things you like about yourself
 
 * write down things you're proud of
 
 * work on your confidence.
 
 Finding help online
 
 Talking to people going through depression in online communities can help you to open up. You can get support and let your feelings out. But it's important to make sure you stay safe online.
 
 Social networks are usually public. And anyone might be able to see something you post. Make sure you're comfortable about it being seen by lots of people. Some young people have experienced bullying on social networks like Tumblr or Instagram after they have tagged a post with 'depression' and it's important to make sure you're safe. Bullying doesn't always happen and lots of people are really supportive online.
 
 Sometimes it's hard to know if an online community is making things better or worse. It's important to remember that online tests and communities can't replace talking to your doctor. If you've been sent nasty comments about depression, it's best not to reply. It's also a good idea to take screenshots of the messages, so you can show them to an adult you trust.
 
 The Childline message boards are a safe place to talk about depression - or anything else that's on your mind.
 
 Other sites we'd recommend:
 
 * YoungMinds can give you advice about mental health and emotional wellbeing
 
 * Beat  support anyone who's been affected by eating disorders
 
 * NHS Choices can help you find your local doctor and give you advice about health.
 
 HOW DEPRESSION CAN AFFECT YOU
 
 Depression affects people in different ways. It can make it hard to concentrate and lead to you feeling negative about everything and like you'll never feel okay again.
 
 Feeling depressed can be really hard to deal with. Some people start to self-harm by hurting themselves, taking drugs, drinking a lot of alcohol or deliberately putting themselves in risky situations. It's really important to get help if you're doing this. 
 
 It's common for many young people to have problems with food at some time in their lives. When some people become depressed they might find they also start to have problems with eating. They might try to starve themselves, overeat, vomit or use laxatives to lose weight after overeating. If you're worried about anything to do with eating, you can get help on our pages about eating problems.
 
 Some people who experience really serious depression might feel so bad about themselves and their life that they think that the only way out is to kill themselves. If you're having suicidal thoughts or feelings or are worried about one of your friends, you're not alone and there's help for you. Please call a Childline counsellor for free on 0800 1111 or talk to someone you trust about it.

 BRING OUT THE BEST IN YOU
 
 Self-esteem is how you think and feel about yourself. Being confident means being comfortable with how you look and how you feel. And it means feeling good about yourself, your abilities and your thoughts.
 
 Sometimes your confidence can go up and down depending on the situation you're in. You might be really outgoing outside of school but be really shy in class. This is completely normal. At school, you're surrounded by lots of different people and it can be difficult to speak up and be yourself.
 
 Building up your confidence can take time. But we're here for you. Taking small steps can often lead to a big change. And you don't have to do it on your own.
 
 5 things you can try:
 
 1. walk with your head held high
 
 2. wear a bright colour or something new
 
 3. do something you haven't done before
 
 4. eat healthy meals
 
 5. exercise regularly.
 
 TIPS TO BOOST YOUR CONFIDENCE
 
 Building your confidence can take time. But there are lots of things you can try to help you feel more confident in any situation.
 
 Act as if you already have confidence
 
 Whenever you wish that you had a certain quality, practise acting 'as if' you already had that quality. If you want to look more confident, practise walking with your head upright or wear a bright colour.
 
 If you're shy, you could talk to someone at school who you haven't spoken to before. These things can seem scary at first. But after you've done it once, you'll slowly gain the confidence to do it again and eventually, it will come naturally. Find out more about being assertive.
 
 Look at yourself differently
 
 No matter how low you feel, try to find one thing that you like about yourself. It could be your hair, your sense of humour, your excellent taste in music, or your football skills. Once you've made that start, you can begin to think of more things and create a positive image of yourself. 
 
 Why not post on the message board and see what others have written?
 
 Watch your words
 
 Sometimes the way you say something can make a big difference to how you feel, and what others think of you. Take a few moments before you answer a question - this can help you feel more confident about what you're saying.
 
 If you are not sure, ask to repeat the question or say you don't understand. Don't pretend to know. Try using words like 'yes' and 'no' instead of 'sort of' and 'not really'. This can make you sound more clear and confident.
 
 Try something new
 
 Try a new thing every day. It should be something that you wouldn't usually do. It could be a small thing, from styling your hair differently to volunteering to read out loud in class or joining a team.
 
 Each time you do something new, you are slowly stepping out of your comfort zone to making a fresh start. The rush you'll get from making these changes will boost your confidence. Take a look at the hobbies and interests?message board to see what new things other people are trying.
 
 Listen to music
 
 Music can have a powerful impact on us. Whenever you begin to doubt yourself, try listening to songs that make you feel positive about life and about yourself.
 
 Check out our music and entertainment message board for ideas and to which songs other people like.
 
 Eat better, feel better
 
 Look after yourself physically. It can really make you more confident. Eating healthily and doing exercise can make a big difference. Try not to eat a lot of processed food like crisps, chocolate and ready meals. And don't drink too much coffee. Instead, choose fresh fruit and vegetables and drink plenty of water.
 
 By looking after yourself this way, you will naturally feel better and have more energy. Try our tips for staying healthy.
 
 Be kind
 
 Help a friend or do a little task without being asked. Phone someone who you haven't spoken to in a while. Bake a cake or cook a meal for someone. Offer to walk a neighbour's dog or volunteer for a charity.
 
 Helping others can make you feel appreciated and valued. Find out more about helping a friend.
 
 Change the way you think
 
 Taking the time to notice when things go well and realising when you're being too hard on yourself can improve your self-esteem and make you feel better.
 
 Whenever something happens and you have a negative thought about yourself, ask yourself whether you've done anything wrong.
 
 For example, if a teacher doesn't pick you, you might feel like you're not good enough. But it could also be that the teacher didn't realise you wanted to be picked. Or they wanted to give someone else a turn.
 
 Even if you think you have done something wrong, try thinking about what you'd like to do differently next time.
 
 Thinking of positive things can be difficult if you're used to putting yourself down. But you can use the mood journal in your locker to help.
 
 Try writing down your moods every day. Question your negative thoughts and try asking someone you trust about them. Make sure you write down anything positive you do, even if it's small.
 
 BUILDING CONFIDENCE AFTER BULLYING
 
 Bullying or cyberbullying can really affect your confidence and sometimes it can feel like it's your fault, even though this isn't true.
 
 Feeling better about yourself can take time, but our tips can help if you're struggling.
 
 Talk to someone
 
 Having someone listen to you can help you to feel less alone. You could talk to a friend, family member or another adult you trust. And you can always talk to us. 
 
 Try something new
 
 You could start a new hobby, make something creative or challenge yourself to say hello to someone new every day. It could be anything.
 
 Let go of your guilt
 
 Lots of people blame themselves for being bullied or end up thinking they deserved it. But bullying is done by the bully, and it's never your fault. Try imagining what you'd say to a friend if they'd been bullied and felt guilty. 
 
 Be proud of what makes you different
 
 Difference is amazing. And the world would be boring if everyone was the same. If someone's made you feel bad for being or looking different, or bullied you about your race, gender, or because you have a disability, it can be really upsetting. Try making a list of all the things that you like about being different or that you're proud of. You can always ask a Childline counsellor to help you. 
 
 Take your time
 
 Building confidence isn't easy and it can take time to feel better. Taking small steps every day can make a big difference. Try using the mood journal to write down what you've tried and how it made you feel.

 COPING WITH BREAK-UPS
 
 Relationship worries can have a big impact on our confidence. People break up for all sorts of reasons, but it can leave you thinking, 'What's wrong with me?'
 
 You might start to question yourself, the way you look or whether you should've done something differently. It's natural to compare yourself to others too. But a break up doesn't mean that you're better or worse, and it doesn't mean that someone else won't like you for who you are.
 
 What you can do to help:
 
 * speak to your friends or someone you trust
 
 * create a positive picture of yourself using the Art box
 
 * post on the message boards for advice

 WHAT IS GUILT?
 
 Guilt is a complicated emotion. And it can be confusing. It's something we generally don't like to feel. You can feel guilty when you regret something you've done or said that you can't take back. It might feel like your conscience is reminding you about what happened.
 
 You may also feel guilty about small things, that aren't that bad, but you tell yourself they're really terrible. And sometimes other people might make you feel guilty - even though you haven't done anything wrong. 
 
 Feeling guilty doesn't always mean you've done something wrong though. There are lots of reasons we can feel this way. And there are always things you can do to make yourself feel better again. 
 
 Lots of things can make us feel guilty. It might be:
 
 * being mean to someone or bullying
 
 * being involved in something illegal 
 
 * self-harming
 
 * drinking alcohol, smoking or taking drugs
 
 * fancying a friend's boyfriend or girlfriend
 
 * cheating in an exam or copying someone's work.
 
 UNDERSTANDING YOUR FEELINGS
 
 People experience guilt differently. It can feel like a bit like a shadow that follows you everywhere. Or a heavy weight in your body that won't go away. Other times it can just be a little niggling feeling that makes you feel bad every now and again.
 
 Your guilt might be trying to tell you something
 
 Guilt can be useful if it's reminding us about something we need to face up to. It can encourage us to change the way we behave for the better. For example, if you feel bad because you haven't been studying, it might motivate you to start so you don't feel guilty anymore.
 
 If you feel guilty about something specific, you could make a deal with yourself to do something about it. This could be a simple thing, like saying sorry to someone or finding ways to get help.
 
 Sometimes you can feel guilty for taking care of yourself. It's something we all need to do sometimes. If you are feeling guilty for putting yourself first, it can help to think about what makes you feel this way and who might be able to help.

 IT'S NOT ALWAYS YOUR FAULT
 
 Feeling guilty doesn't always make sense. Sometimes it can be difficult to work out if something really was your fault.
 
 Other people can make you feel guilty about something that wasn't your fault.
 
 When people around you are doing things they shouldn't, they might blame you rather than taking responsibility for what they're doing.

 Getting through a tough time
 
 If you're struggling with something that's happened, we've got some advice to help.
 
 WAYS TO FEEL BETTER
 
 Try talking to someone
 
 Talking can help you to make sense of how you're feeling. It's a good way of deciding if you want to do anything about what's happened. It can also be a useful first step in working out if what has happened is really your fault or if someone is just making you feel like this.
 
 Try talking to someone you trust or to other people on our?message boards.
 
 Get advice about asking an adult for help.
 
 Write stuff down
 
 If it feels too difficult to talk about how you're feeling you could try writing it down. Make sure it's somewhere safe where people won't see it if you don't want them to. List all the things you think you did or said that you're feeling guilty about. For each of these things, write down what other emotions you were feeling at the time and what else was going through your mind.
 
 Try to write down answers to these questions:
 
 * Do I still feel the same now?
 
 * Was anyone else involved?
 
 * Is there anything I want to do differently?
 
 Once you've got all your thoughts and feelings out, you might find you start to feel different. When you feel ready to move on, you can choose what you want to do with what you have written. You could show it to someone, tear it up into a hundred pieces or lock it away in a safe place. It's up to you. 
 
 Say sorry
 
 Sometimes we need to apologise. You might feel like saying sorry to someone you've bullied?or treated badly. Some people have spoken to us about feeling guilty after stealing or lying. You can't always make things right, but it's good to try. Saying sorry and explaining ourselves can help us move on.
 
 And when things don't work out the way you want to, it can help to think of ways to forgive yourself.
 
 Forgive yourself
 
 It's the hardest thing to do when you feel really guilty but it is really important to try to not keep blaming yourself. If you keep beating yourself up for things that you can't change or weren't really your fault, it can have a negative effect on your life and how you feel.
 
 There comes a time when you need to stop blaming yourself and let it go. Everyone has done things that they regret or feel bad about.

 TRUSTING OTHERS
 
 If you've been hurt by people in the past, it can be hard to trust new people you meet. This can make you feel lonely. Over time, you'll meet so many people that not every person will become a close friend. 
 
 When you meet someone new, give yourself time to get to know them properly before you trust them. Think about what you like about them. If you can't think of many good things about them, or aren't sure how you feel about them, this might mean that they're going to be just someone you know rather than a close friend.

 GRIEVING AND DEALING WITH LOSS
 
 The death of someone you care about can be very difficult. These feelings are sometimes called grief. It's natural to have strong reactions when someone you love or are close to dies.
 
 You might feel:
 
 * like you can't handle things
 
 * confused
 
 * scared, numb or that you've lost control
 
 * worried that you may never feel okay again.
 
 Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to feel better straight away. These feelings will change over time. It's important to try to accept how you feel.
 
 You might also be upset about the death of an animal or pet. Or when someone's still alive but you're not able to see or talk to them anymore. This can hurt as much as a relative or friend dying.
 
 4 things to remember
 
 * Talk to someone who'll listen to how you feel - it can really help.
 
 * However you're feeling is okay, cry if you feel like it.
 
 * Look after yourself - remember to eat well and get plenty of rest.
 
 * Things can get easier over time.

 WHO TO TALK TO ABOUT HOW YOU'RE FEELING
 
 It can be difficult knowing who to talk to if you're worried about upsetting someone or if you feel like they won't understand. If someone else is grieving too you might not want to bother them. But sharing your feelings can really help. And you only need to tell people what you feel comfortable sharing. You could try talking to:
 
 * someone you trust, such as a family member or close friend
 
 * a teacher or another adult at school
 
 * a Childline counsellor
 
 * other people who've experienced similar feelings - look at our message board thread about bereavement
 
 If you're finding things difficult, it might be a good idea to visit your doctor. They may be able to give you some support with getting through the first few months as you adjust to such a big change.

 SAYING GOODBYE TO SOMEONE WHO HAS DIED
 
 Funerals and memorial services
 
 A funeral is a ceremony for friends and family to celebrate the life of the person who has died and to say goodbye to them.
 
 There are lots of different kinds of funeral. People might say a little about the person who died or there might be music or poetry. Funerals can be religious and they might involve prayers but they don't have to be. After a funeral, the person who died will often be buried or cremated.
 
 Going to a funeral might feel scary or overwhelming, especially if it's for someone you were close to. You might not be sure if you want to go or if you'll be allowed to. But if you do decide to go, it can help you to say goodbye to someone who has died.
 
 It's important to think about whether you would like to go to a funeral. You could decide to go for the whole thing or just part of the ceremony. Sometimes it can help to ask an adult you trust or a friend to help support you on the day or answer questions if you're not sure what to do.
 
 If you don't want to go, or you're not allowed, it can sometimes help to have a say in what happens at the funeral. You could suggest a song or poem that the person who died would have liked, or help plan what will happen.
 
 Burials and cremations
 
 At the end of a funeral, the person who has died may be buried or cremated.
 
 When someone who has died is buried, they'll be taken in a coffin to a cemetery or churchyard. The coffin will be lowered into a hole in the ground and it'll be covered with earth. Often family and friends are allowed to gather round as it's lowered.
 
 After, a headstone with their name is put down to mark the spot.
 
 At a cremation, the coffin will be taken away at the end of the service (either behind a curtain or lowered down). The coffin and the body will be burned until only ashes remain. The family will be given the ashes later on. Some people keep the ashes in an urn, others might choose to bury or scatter them somewhere special.
 
 Cremations and burials can bring up lots of feelings. If you want to talk about what's happened, or about the person who has died, we're here for you.
 
 Remembering someone who has died
 
 Lots of people worry about forgetting someone who has died. It can help to collect things that help remind you of the person, like photos, gifts or small things like photos of places you've been together. You can keep these in a box or a safe place and take out a reminder any time you want.
 
 You might want to visit the grave or the place the ashes were scattered. But sometimes this can feel scary. If you're not sure, it can help to ask an adult you trust.
 
 You may find that birthdays and special events are times when you miss them most. But doing something to remember them on the day can really help.
 
 LOSING SOMEONE TO SUICIDE
 
 Someone dying can affect you no matter how it happens. But when someone takes their own life it can feel even more difficult to cope. You might be:
 
 * scared or worried about how other people might react
 
 * angry at the person who died
 
 * guilty or ashamed about things you feel you could've done differently
 
 * confused about why they took their own life
 
 * feeling rejected or ignored by the person who died
 
 * numb or relieved about someone's suffering being over.
 
 3 ways to help you cope:
 
 * Talk to someone you trust - Talk to your family, a friend or even a Childline Counsellor about how you're feeling.
 
 * Write things down - This can help you to understand things more. You could keep what you've written, show someone or even destroy it.
 
 * Keep a memory box - In a box, keep different things that remind you of the person who died.
 
 WHEN AN ONLINE FRIEND DIES
 
 It can be really difficult if you find out that one of your online friends has died. You might feel very upset but find it hard to explain this to others. Some people might think you shouldn't feel so sad because you didn't know this person in the 'real' world.
 
 But losing an online friend, especially one that you felt close to, can bring about the same feelings of loss and grief as losing a friend you know in person.
 
 If this happens, you might find it helpful to speak to other people who were also online friends with them. You could also speak to an adult you trust about how you feel. Childline counsellors are here to listen to you and support you.
 
 MEMORY STONES
 
 Speak to an adult you trust about helping you to find 3 small stones - a smooth stone, a rough stone and a gemstone.
 
 When you have all 3, follow these steps:
 
 1. Smooth stone - Hold the stone in your hand and think about the ordinary memories of the person who died, like their favourite food or drink or what kind of shoes they wore.
 
 2. Rough stone - Hold the stone in your hand and think about some of your difficult memories, like what happened when you first found out they died.
 
 3. Gemstone - Hold the stone in your hand and think about your special memories of the person, like TV you used to watch together or any holidays you went on.
 
 Keep all of the stones together somewhere safe. When you feel ready you could show the stones to an adult you trust to share the different memories or tell a Childline counsellor about them.
 
 Talking about what each of the stones represent can help you feel able to hold the stones in one hand together. It can remind you that even with the difficult memories you can still have the ordinary and special memories too.
 
 It can take time to find the words and to begin to understand what has happened. But Childline is here to talk to you any time.

 HELPING SOMEONE ELSE COPE WITH DEATH
 
 It can be hard for you when a family member or friend is finding it difficult to cope with the death of someone.
 
 You can try:
 
 * letting them know that you're there to listen to them
 
 * giving them space if they want to be alone
 
 * being there for them if they want to cry or talk about their feelings
 
 * encouraging them to think of the happy times they had with the person who died
 
 * reminding them that it can take a long time to feel better and that this is normal
 
 * doing things like make a cup of tea for them or help with chores.

 FEELING LOSS WHEN SOMEONE HASN'T DIED
 
 There are lots of ways someone might feel like they've lost someone or something, even when nobody's died. You might:
 
 * miss someone after a relationship has ended
 
 * not be allowed to see someone in your family anymore
 
 * have a family member with dementia
 
 * move home or change schools
 
 * not see your family after going into care
 
 * have moved on from services that support you.
 
 Losing someone or something can bring up many of the same feelings as when someone has died. Especially if you can't talk to the person you've lost.
 
 Whatever's happened, it can really help to talk about how you're feeling to someone you trust or with Childline. If you're struggling, sometimes it can help to create something in the Art box.

 WHAT YOU CAN DO
 
 Find ways to cope
 
 There are lots of different ways to help you cope if you ever feel suicidal. Exercise can help. So does doing something creative, like art or writing. Many young people listen to music. Some people set themselves small goals or make a list of anything, even small things, that makes them smile. There are lots of ways of coping with feeling down or experiencing suicidal feelings.
 
 Take a look at our coping with suicidal feelings advice for more ideas on what you can do.
 
 Talk to someone
 
 Telling someone how you feel helps. It means you don't have to carry the weight of it around all on your own. And it can make it feel easier to carry the load. Remember you have control over how much you tell them. You could tell them everything. Or you could only say just a bit. It's up to you. It's important to feel comfortable with how much you tell someone.
 
 It's also important to be comfortable with the person you tell. Make sure it's someone you trust. It could be someone who has helped you before.
 
 It can feel scary to tell someone something serious like having suicidal thoughts, but talking about it can be a relief. The fear often passes. If you don't want to tell them face to face, that's okay. You could tell them in a letter, an email or a drawing.
 
 Read more about asking an adult for help.
 
 See a doctor
 
 If you feel suicidal, going to see a doctor can really help. Doctors won't judge you and they'll keep what you've told them private, unless they think you're in serious danger. You might find that just having a safe space to be honest about how you're feeling helps lift the strain off you a little bit.
 
 A doctor could help you think about what may be causing your suicidal thoughts. They might also be able to prescribe you treatment to help you get better. They may set you up with another type of professional help - like counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Get more information about visiting a doctor.

 SIGNS THAT SOMEBODY MIGHT BE SUICIDAL
 
 Somebody who is feeling suicidal might:
 
 * be feeling depressed or withdrawn (they might stop wanting to see their friends or do things they normally like doing)
 
 * start doing dangerous things like taking drugs or drinking alcohol
 
 * give away things they own
 
 * stop looking after themselves (they might not wash as often or care about their appearance as much as they used to)
 
 Somebody who is feeling suicidal might say things like:
 
 * ""It'll be over soon""
 
 * ""I'm better off dead""
 
 * ""I don't want to be here anymore""
 
 * ""I won't be missed""
 
 HELPING A FRIEND WHO FEELS SUICIDAL
 
 Caring for your friend is the best thing you can do. Just being there for them can help them start to feel better. Listen to their story. Your friend might tell you why they feel sad or hopeless. Say you understand why they might feel like this - but tell them you don't want them to react by ending their own life.
 
 People who feel suicidal often feel hopeless. But you can give hope back to your friend. Suggest future plans or things you can do together. It could be anything, like a bike ride together or a trip to the cinema each week. It could even be something small like playing a computer game together. Just remember that it's not all up to you to help them cope.
 
 Tell your friend how important they are to you. Think carefully about them and tell them why they are a good friend for you.
 
 You can also encourage your friend to talk to a Childline counsellor or a doctor. It really helps to talk to someone. They might find it easier to talk to someone who they don't know.
 
 Remember that you're not responsible for stopping your friend from hurting themselves. It's important that you get support too. If helping your friend is difficult or upsetting, you can talk to a Childline counsellor for support too.

 IS SELF-HARM THE SAME AS BEING SUICIDAL?
 
 Self-harm is when someone hurts themselves on purpose. It can be a way of dealing with difficult or painful feelings. If someone self-harms, it doesn't always mean they're suicidal.
 
 Some types of self-harm can be very dangerous. It could put someone's life at risk, even if they're not suicidal. If you or a friend have self-harmed and you think it could be dangerous, get help straight away by calling 999.
 
 Who self-harms?
 
 There are a few myths about the type of person who self-harms. But lots of different types of people struggle with self-harm. Boys and girls. Young and old. People from different backgrounds and with different tastes in music. Lots of people are affected by self-harm. The important thing to remember is you're not alone and you can get help.

 GETTING SUPPORT
 
 It's really important to speak to someone if you feel suicidal or you're worried you'll harm yourself.

 Taking drugs or drinking alcohol makes it hard to think clearly and make good decisions. Alcohol is also a depressant which make suicidal feelings even worse.
 
 If you have any drugs, flush them away. If you have anything that could harm you, get rid of it. It also helps to be with someone instead of being on your own.
 
 5 things you can do
 
 1. hobbies or stuff you enjoy like listening to music (not something that could make things worse like drugs and alcohol)
 
 2. physical activity like sports, dancing, jogging or yoga
 
 3. talking to someone you trust or to others on our message boards
 
 4. something that give you a sense of achievement, like drawing or doing a puzzle
 
 5. look at a photo of someone who really cares about you.
 
 MAKING A SAFETY PLAN

 Our counsellors are always here for you and can help you to write your safety plan.
 
 Try to think of:
 
 * Ways you can keep yourself safe
 
 * A safe place you can go
 
 * Anything that's helped in the past when you've had these thoughts
 
 * Any positive thoughts or feelings you could try focus on instead
 
 * What you'd say to a friend who was having these feelings
 
 * Someone you can talk to, like a Childline counsellor?or adult you trust.

 Fill your comfort box with all your favourite things. You could have photos of people you care about, inspirational quotes or song lyrics you like, your favourite snacks and gifts from someone you love. Turn to your comfort box when you're struggling.
 
 Imagine
 
 Imagine things are going well and you're coping. In your mind, picture a favourite place. It could be somewhere real or made-up. Imagine you're there. Create a mental image of yourself coping really well and getting help with what's going on. 
 
 Repeat a positive phrase
 
 Think of a positive phrase which reminds you that you can cope with things.
 
 It should be in the first person (""I"" and ""me""). And in the present tense (""I am"" or ""I do"" NOT ""I will"" or ""I am going to"") 
 
 You could try repeating these positive phrases to yourself:
 
 * ""I am doing really well""
 
 * ""I am getting through this""
 
 * ""I have a lot to give""
 
 Or try making up some of your own. Get more ideas on our message boards.
 
 Exercise
 
 Doing exercise is great for your mental health. It can relax you. And give you more energy. It can also make you feel more confident and help you deal with things.
 
 It's important to find a type of exercise that's right for you. Everyone enjoys something different. It could be running, walking, football, skipping, dancing or yoga. You could try a few different things and see what you like.

 USE YOUR SENSES TO COPE
 
 Your 5 senses are powerful tools. They can really lift your mood if you're going through a difficult time or feeling suicidal. Here are some ideas.
 
 See
 
 Create a space in your room or diary and fill it with pictures or things that you like - the things you feel good about. You could look at old pictures that bring up good memories. Or watch one of your favourite films. You can also use our Art box to create, save and print your own images.
 
 Hear
 
 Put on the music you love. It could be something soft and soothing. Or it could be loud and exciting. Whatever you're into. If you're not in the mood for music, try going to a park and just listening to the sound of birds and trees. Focussing on these noises can help block out worrying thoughts.
 
 Smell
 
 Everyone has a few favourite smells. So think about what smells you like and try to enjoy them when you're feeling down or stressed. Take your time to breathe them in. Focus on the smell and try to block out your other thoughts. It could be a certain perfume or shampoo. Maybe oranges, toast or food being cooked. Or it might be the smell of freshly cut grass. 
 
 Taste
 
 Have your favourite meal. Or you could eat something you used to love, but haven't had in a while. Try different flavours and textures. And don't forget to try eating healthy food as this can affect your mood. Check out our advice on staying healthy.
 
 Touch
 
 Touching different things can make you feel a connection with the world around you. And can also take your mind off worrying thoughts. Run your tongue around your mouth and feel the different surfaces. Gently touch walls in your school or home. Feel the zip or buttons on a jacket. Have a bath. Stroke your pet. Give yourself a hand massage or feel the texture of each of your fingernails. Exercise or lift weights. Go for a walk or run. 
 
 Try tracking your mood
 
 Go to your locker to track your mood and record when you've used these different senses. This can help you work out what things make you feel better or worse.
 
 TALKING TO SOMEONE
 
 Talking to someone about how you feel is a really important part of getting help. It means you don't have to deal with everything on your own. 
 
 But it's not always easy to do. Describing how you feel can feel really scary.
 
 Try our tips to make it easier to talk:
 
 * plan and prepare what you want to say
 
 * write down what you want to say and practise saying it
 
 * think about the main things you want to get out of talking to someone
 
 * ask yourself if you want advice, or if you just want to say how you're feeling
 
 * try talking when the person isn't busy or about to rush off.
 
 KEEPING THE CONVERSATION GOING
 
 It's good to talk about a problem. But what if you told someone and it didn't help?
 
 Talking about an issue is often a process. It's not just something you do once.
 
 Telling someone how you feel might make you feel bad at first. But after a few times of talking about it, you could start to feel differently.
 
 And it doesn't have to be new information either. Sometimes talking about the same things again and again can help you understand what you're going through.
 
 So remember, if you told someone how you feel but it didn't help - keep trying. And think of other people you trust who might be able to help.
 
 WHO YOU  CAN TALK  TO
 
 Asking an adult for help
 
 If you have a problem you can't fix on your own, it's a good idea to ask an adult you trust for help. They could help you see your problem differently. They might have been through something similar themselves. Or have ideas on how to cope with things.
 
 Seeing your doctor
 
 If you feel suicidal, seeing a doctor can really help. Doctors shouldn't judge you and they should keep what you've told them private, unless they think you're in serious danger. They can help you find ways to cope and give you advice about types of treatment.
 
 You can talk to us about anything
 
 Whatever you say will be just between you and Childline. And you can feel safe talking to us, knowing that no one else will find out.

 WHY PEOPLE SELF-HARM
 
 Self-harm can affect anyone. Young people have told us that they use self-harm to cope with difficult thoughts or feelings, but there are lots of reasons people start.
 
 Some young people start self-harming after something's happened, like being bullied or abused. Others have said they self-harmed because of things like pressure at school. Sometimes you might not even know why you started.
 
 Self-harm is sometimes seen as the only way to cope or take control, but that's not true.
 
 Whatever’s going on, Childline’s always here for you. Check out our techniques for?coping with self-harm?or talk to a?counsellor?if you need help right away.
 
 Things to remember:
 
 ?there are lots of different reasons why someone might self-harm
 
 ?there are other ways to cope without self-harming – and different things work for different people.
 
 ?self-harm doesn’t define you – there are lots of things that make you who you are
 
 ?it’s better to?talk to someone?and get help, rather than keep it all inside

 HOW DO I TELL SOMEONE I SELF-HARM?
 
 Lots of young people have said that telling someone about their self-harm was one of the best ways of coping.?Talking is important because it means you don’t have to deal with everything on your own. But it’s not always easy. It’s often really hard to know why you’re self-harming. Explaining it to someone else can feel even harder. So how can you tell someone about it?
 
 Is there someone in your life you feel comfortable with? If you feel you can trust them, you could open up to them. It could be a friend, a teacher, an?adult you trust, a nurse or a?Childline counsellor.
 
 Think about what you want from a conversation.?Write down?what you want to say before you talk to the person. This can help make sure you don’t forget.
 
 Do you just want someone else to know how you’re feeling? Or are you hoping they'll give you some practical support and ideas to get better? It’s okay to tell them what you’re hoping to get from the conversation.
 
 If you’re still not sure how to talk to someone about self-harm,?you can prepare with a Childline counsellor.

 SELF-HARM ON SOCIAL MEDIA
 
 Some self-harm websites and social media accounts can be helpful, but there are lots that might make you want to self-harm more.
 
 It might seem like people in your life don’t understand what you’re going through. And going on self-harm blogs or posting a self-harm photo could make you feel less alone at first. But after a while, these types of sites can make things much worse and can make it even harder to stop self-harming.
 
 Even if it feels like you have nobody to support you, there are people out there who want to help you cope. Check out the Childline?self-harm message boards. This is a positive community of people who know what you’re going through. They won’t judge you. But they'll try to help you recover.

 Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter - keeping up with them all is a full time job and it's super important to make sure that we're posting enough every day to make sure our friends know we're having fun all the time and that we're really happy and that we look really great - right? Right..?
 
 Actually - newsflash - too much time online can stress you out big time but you might not recognise the moment when it stops being fun and starts getting stressful. Think about it - how many of the hundreds of followers and friends you have online are actually your friends? In real life, most people only have five or six close friends who they can really be themselves around - which means it's sooooooo important to see them and hang out and chill or go dancing or whatever you like to do together. You've just gotta enjoy their company in the real world. It's easy to see what people are up to online - without you - and think ""I don't have any friends"" and get jealous but then, when you're actually with your friends, spend your time posting instead of enjoying it and living the moment. Which, when you think about it, is kind of funny, right?
 
 If this sounds familiar, and if you ever worry that you have no friends or no life because of what you see online, then it's okay - just switch off the screen and chat to your real life friends, face-to-face, in the real world. That's what matters most.

 Image source: Flickr
 
 Have you ever ditched the idea of trying out for the school play because you were sure you weren't good enough? Ever get the feeling that you were just born cranky? Those feelings are called pessimism, and they can weaken the power of positive thinking.
 
 The opposite of pessimism is optimism
 
 Research shows that with the power of positive thinking, the more optimistic we are, the happier our lives will be.
 
 Those who have a sunnier outlook about the future have better mental health than those who are pessimistic. Optimists show less stress and depression, have deep friendships, and demonstrate superior coping skills. It's not that they have more friends, but their relationships are close and strong. They see a bad situation as a challenge, not a setback. They benefit from the power of positive thinking.
 
 But how do you tap into the power of positive thinking? First, you have to be more true to yourself. We've compiled a few suggestions you can try to brighten your outlook when pessimism stops by for a visit.
 
 1. Just do it. Don't let fear of not being perfect prevent you from trying something new. Even if you don't do as well as you'd like the first few times, keep in mind that just challenging yourself takes guts. Remember the power of positive thinking and you will find your niche.
 
 2. Analyse your friends. If your friends are not supportive, if you don't feel good about yourself when you're with them, it might be time to explore new friendships with people who share the power of positive thinking. From art lessons or mountain biking to drama club or dance class, spending time with positive people might be a solution to the blahs.
 
 3. Do good and you'll feel good. The feeling of personal accomplishment that comes with volunteering your time and energies for a good cause has been documented in hundreds of studies. Lending a helping hand is another good way to feel the power of positive thinking.
 
 4. Get physical. Physical activity is a big-time spirit booster.  A good workout releases mood-enhancing hormones that are nature's solution to negativity.

 Image source: Flickr
 
 'I could understand feeling that nauseous and nervous if I was trying out for the lead in the play, or I was asking out the cutest boy in school, but all I was doing was raising my hand and offering a way to raise money for some new gym equipment,' sighs Julie. 'I just sat there, letting Miss Know-It-All get credit for an idea that wasn't anywhere near as good as mine. I hated myself for a week.'
 
 Leaders have self-confidence. So do great athletes. And probably the friends you admire the most.  'It' is self-confidence, the ability to know and accept your strengths and limitations without depending on the opinions of those around you.'  If you think you're alone in envying those with a 'Look out world, here I am,' attitude, take heart. It's been documented that the two greatest fears we have are not snakes or crime or natural disasters, not getting caught cheating or telling a lie, not getting your period and being totally unprepared, but meeting strangers and standing up to speak in front of a group, and to do this, you need self confidence, which is easier said than done.
 
 For too many of us it's easier to run a marathon than say something nice about ourselves.
 
 It's some crazy notion that only stuck up, full of themselves people can find something positive to say. Think of the confident people you know. Isn't it their self confidence, as much as their ideas and ability, that reassures you they know what they're doing? For those times the limelight is near and you feel you need a lifeline, try:
 
 1. Visualising yourself as you wish you would be. How would you act if you weren't shy? What would you say if you felt confident? Picture yourself talking with self confidence and then follow that behaviour.
 
 2. Writing down everything you're anxious about beforehand...I'll make a fool out of myself, people will think less of me, I'll fail...then afterward, see if any of your worries came to pass.
 
 3. Chances are you'll see all your angst was a waste of energy and improve your self confidence.
 
 4. Chanting these mantras or at least posting them around your room: SUCCESS IS 99% FAILURE. IF YOU THINK YOU CAN, YOU CAN. IF YOU THINK YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T, and the all-important 10 most powerful two-letter words, IF IT IS TO BE, IT IS UP TO ME.
 
 5. Taking a deep breath and asking for a moment to focus. Then do your best to avoid looking around to see who is looking at you.
 
 6. Avoiding caffeine, carbohydrates, and sugar before your big moment. Protein will help keep your energy at an even level.
 
 7. Remembering all the great people who regained faith in themselves after being told they didn't have what it takes to succeed.
 
 Self Confidence Idols:
 
 ? Einstein was four years old before he could speak.
 
 ? Isaac Newton did so poorly in school, his teachers considered him 'Unpromising'.
 
 ? Beethoven's music teacher rated him 'hopeless'.
 
 ? Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team.
 
 ? Walt Disney was fired for 'a lack of imagination'.
 
 ? Winston Churchill failed Year Six because he didn't complete the tests required for promotion.

 By Rebecca, 14.
 
 ""I wanna look like her""
 
 ""Why can't I be him?""
 
 ""Why am I like this?""
 
 Do you ever wish you could look like someone else?
 
 It's normal for anyone to want to improve themselves, but what's not good is to let jealousy or envy change the way you feel towards your own body. Ever heard that cliché, ""Be yourself; everyone else is taken""? Well you need to start believing it, because wanting to be like someone else could give you loads of insecurities and make you feel like you aren't good enough.
 
 1. Concentrate on your strengths
 
 You may not have the body you see in films or the hair you see on TV, but remember what you do have! Everyone has a unique set of strengths that make us beautiful individuals. We all have different personalities that make us special; you just need to concentrate on all the good you can offer to the world!
 
 2. Speak to someone you trust
 
 Whether it's your parents or close friends, you can talk to them about the way you feel, I'm sure they could help you feel better about yourself. Sometimes all you need is a little boost of confidence from someone who cares about you to make you feel special! After all, what are friends for?
 
 3. Be realistic
 
 Every day we see magazines and social media and we're shown what the media tells us is the perfect body or the perfect relationship. But c'mon - can we really use the media to tell us how we should be - especially with all the airbrushing that's going on? Liking the way someone looks is fine, but it's not so fine trying to be exactly like them. Being unique means being distinctive and without you, the world will be missing out on someone really special!

206,0,"Why Do I Feel Suicidal?
 
 Potentially, 1 in 4 young people may experience thoughts of suicide at any one time - that's a lot of people. Anyone can feel suicidal and it can be for any reason. Many people who contact HOPELINEUK tell us they feel suicidal because they feel isolated and alone, because something has happened which feels too overwhelming, because being alive feels too hard or maybe because they feel trapped and unable to escape from a situation.
 
 Suicidal thoughts can occur even if life feels like it's going well. This can lead to feelings of guilt; especially if you compare yourself to others who you imagine have it worse than you.
 
 Some people feel suicidal if they're dying or if someone they know is dying. Others may feel suicidal if they struggle with chronic pain, physical health problems, mental health problems or spiritual problems.
 
 Life experiences can also lead to feeling suicidal. Abuse, assault, a job loss, money worries, addiction, bullying, bereavement and sexuality worries might be struggles which lead someone to think about suicide.
 
 When we feel like this, or when things happen we feel unable to cope with, suicide can start to feel like the only option to escape. If you are finding it hard to talk to anyone about how you are struggling, or you are feeling hopeless about getting help, thoughts of suicide might be harder to experience.
 
 Struggling with your mental health can also make it more difficult for you to cope with everyday things too, which can leave you feeling even more trapped or hopeless. We want to reassure you that help is available and that with the right help and support you can start to feel more hopeful and in control of your life. For more information about how to get help you can look at our ""Who can I tell?"" section or speak to one of our Suicide Prevention Advisers by calling HOPELINEUK.
 
 What's important to know is that whatever the reasons are for you feeling suicidal, your reasons are significant and valid. Whatever it is that is troubling you, it is making you think about dying therefore you deserve to be listened to and supported.

207,0,"What Are Thoughts Of Suicide?
 
 Suicide means to end your life intentionally. Experiencing thoughts of suicide can be frightening. Thoughts of suicide can seemingly come from nowhere or begin as fleeting thoughts of wanting to disappear or escape. They may progress into feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness and planning or taking steps to end your life.
 
 You may feel alone, but in fact, it is estimated that 1 in 4 young people experience thoughts of suicide at some point in their lives.
 
 If you are experiencing thoughts of suicide, it's important to know that there is help available. It can be really hard to know who to turn to and it can take a huge amount of courage to talk about thoughts of suicide. Take some time to think about who you might want to tell; maybe someone you trust or you feel would understand you. You don't have to carry these feelings on your own. For more information on how to do this see our Who can I tell? section.
 
 Who can be suicidal?
 
 Anyone can experience thoughts of suicide and everyone is different; what makes suicide feel like an option to one person might be experienced very differently by someone else. And that's okay. For more information, take a look at our next section about why people feel suicidal.

 Talking about our fears and feelings is difficult - even to those we know love and care about us. This can prevent other people from recognising distress and being able to help in crisis. Words are often totally inadequate to convey the amount of pain a person may be suffering. It is easy to understand that someone is hurting if they have been badly injured or are physically ill. Emotional pain cannot be seen, but it can be just as unbearable.
 
 It can be hard to know where to start and you may be feeling worried or anxious about reaching out for help and sharing your thoughts of suicide with others and what will happen - you can read more about this under our FAQs section.
 
 Who can I tell?
 
 It's really brave to think about opening up and talking about thoughts of suicide. Who is in your life right now who you feel may be able to support you? Below are some ideas of some different people and sources of support you could turn to.
 
 ? Your parents or partner
 
 ? Your GP
 
 ? A teacher or university tutor
 
 ? A youth worker or counsellor
 
 ? Your friends or other family members
 
 ? Support services and helplines such as HOPELINEUK.
 
 What do I say?
 
 When reaching out for help, it can be scary to think about what to say or how to say it. Planning what you're going to say and when you're going to say it can help with this.

 What help is available? It can be hard to imagine what type of help or support you can access if you are feeling suicidal. HOPELINEUK advisors can help you find support and explore options with you, as the help available can vary depending on where you live. Support might include:
 
 * Talking therapies such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy
 
 * Medication

209,0,"? I'm thinking about suicide, does that mean I have a mental health problem?
 
 Lots of young people worry that if they are thinking about suicide, this means they are experiencing a mental health problem. People think about suicide for a lot of different reasons and sometimes it's because they feel it's their only escape from a situation that seems impossible or a feeling that they can't imagine ever getting better.
 
 Thinking about suicide doesn't mean you have a mental health problem. In fact, research indicates that as many as one in four young people (between the ages of 16-34) in the UK experience thoughts of suicide at some point. Thoughts of suicide can be a symptom of some mental health problems, such as depression or borderline personality disorder, but it isn't a mental health problem on its own. It's also more common for people with mental health problems to think about suicide -the reasons for this are quite complicated - but many people who think about suicide will have no mental health problems at all.
 
 ? Does having thoughts of suicide mean that I will act on them?
 
 Thinking about suicide does not mean that you will act on these thoughts. At times, thoughts of suicide can be fleeting thoughts that you have no plans to act on. Sometimes, the thoughts of suicide might feel more intense than this and you might think about making plans to act on them. No matter what thoughts of suicide may be like for you, there is always help available, and you don't have to experience them alone.
 
 ? Will I always feel this way?
 
  Even one day with thoughts of suicide can feel like a lifetime, and it can be hard to see a time where you won't feel this way. These thoughts can be really brief, or they can last a while. The important thing to note is that experiencing thoughts of suicide for any amount of time is really difficult but there is always support you can access. You might have these thoughts just one time, for them never to come back again. Sometimes, if something in particular is impacting on these thoughts, it might take getting help with these things for the thoughts of suicide to lessen. It can take time for thoughts of suicide to gradually lessen in intensity. Focus on taking it one step at a time and reward yourself when you reach each one.
 
 Who can help me with my thoughts of suicide? There's lots of different help and support options. It's worth thinking about what's important to you and the kind of help you'd like to try. Feeling suicidal can leave you feeling out of control. Having a say in the help you receive might make you feel a little more in control.
 
 ? PAPYRUS HOPELINEUK is a confidential support and advice service for young people under the age of 35 experiencing thoughts of suicide, or anyone who is concerned about a young person feeling this way. HOPELINEUK is open every day of the year and is staffed by experienced professionals who are trained in suicide intervention skills.
 
 ? Your GP - they are often the first person to talk to about mental health and emotional support, including medication or talking therapies.
 
 ? A counsellor or therapist - this might be through your GP, school, college/university or a local community service or charity.
 
 ? Your teacher or university tutor - they might be able to help take some of the pressure off you at school or university.
 
 ? Your employer may be part of an Employee Assistance Programme or may have an occupational health service which can support you.
 
 ? Your support worker, mental health worker or care co-ordinator - they can help put things in place to support you and keep you safe.
 
 ? Friends or family members - they can offer emotional and practical support.
 
 ? Peer support and support groups. * Online forums and support, such as these.
 
 ? What will happen if I tell someone I feel suicidal?
 
 Telling someone that you feel suicidal can be scary and it can be difficult to know how someone might respond or what might happen next. Usually the person will want to help and support you, even if they aren't always sure how to. It can help to think of someone you really trust or someone who has helped you in the past. It can also help to think about what you want them to understand, and some people find writing down notes as a prompt can be useful. Sometimes the person you tell may have a duty to tell someone else if you share that you feel suicidal. Finding out more about a person's or organisation's limits to confidentiality before opening up may help you feel more comfortable about who you choose to tell.
 
 ? If I tell my GP I feel suicidal will I get sectioned?
 
 Telling your GP how you feel is important so that you can get the help that you need. One thing that people often worry about is whether they will get sectioned if they tell their GP that they are thinking about suicide. Sectioning means being kept in hospital, even if you don't want to be there, to keep you or other people safe. We want to reassure you that it is very unlikely you will be sectioned - your GP will want to help and, where possible, in a way that offers you the most choice and freedom over your care. There may be some situations where your GP may want you to be admitted to hospital but you will often be given the option to go there yourself. If your GP thinks you need to be sectioned, he or she will usually need to contact specially trained mental health practitioners to assess you before you go into hospital. Find more information about sectioning here. It's important to be aware that sectioning is a last resort and only happens vary rarely.
 
 ? If I tell my GP I feel suicidal will they need to tell my parents?
 
 If you are 16 or over, everything you talk to your GP about should be kept confidential between you and them. The only exception to this is if they feel you are an immediate risk to yourself or someone else or if they have a safeguarding concern about a child or vulnerable adult. Your GP should always discuss this with you before they tell someone else. If you are under 16 your GP may need to assess your capacity to make decisions about your healthcare when thinking about whether they will tell your parents. This doesn't mean they can't keep your thoughts of suicide confidential but they might need to think about it a bit differently to someone who is over 16.
 
 If you are worried about this you could try ringing your GP surgery or emailing them to ask about whether you are able to speak in confidence and whether it is their usual policy to involve parents when supporting under 16's. You can also get more information about this here.
 
 ? If I talk to my GP about suicide will it stop me from getting a job in the future?
 
 Employers are not allowed to access your medical records without your consent and they are not allowed to use this confidential information to exclude you from being considered for a job. For some people, thoughts of suicide might be part of an ongoing mental health concern or another condition, which may be covered under The Equality Act (2010) - this is a law that protects people from discrimination. You can see this act here to check that your job is following this act and to find out what to do if they are not.
 
 For some positions or careers, for example nurses, you might need to pass an occupational health assessment before you start working. This is confidential and would not be seen by your employers. Having had support with thoughts of suicide would not mean you wouldn't pass this assessment but the doctor or nurse would want to see that you were able to cope with the demands of the job at the time you were applying for the role, and consider any extra support you might need. This is to protect you and make sure you have the right support when you start work.
 
 ? What can I do if I've asked for help and haven't received it?
 
 Firstly, well done for reaching out and asking for help with thoughts of suicide, as this can take a great deal of courage. If you have done this and are not happy with the support you receive, it is important to know that there is always more help available if you know where to look. If you go to your GP and you don't feel like they have given you the help or support you need, you always have the option to go back and explain this, or to ask to see an alternative GP for a second opinion. You also have the option to file complaints with a service if you feel that your needs are not being met as they should be. For matters relating to mental health, there are also advocacy services that can assign someone to help you to ensure that services are meeting your needs and to let you know what your rights are. You can find information on advocacy here.
 
 Your GP is often the first person you see when looking for help with thoughts of suicide but there are many charities, private services, online support agencies and self-help services that can also help you. Many people access these kinds of services as well as their GP or as an alternative to support from their GP. There's no right or wrong - it depends on whatever works for you and enhances your ability to keep safe from suicide.
 
 Whatever you do: if you are having suicidal thoughts, there is help available for you and many different options to access it.

210,0,"COPING STRATEGIES When trying to cope with overwhelming feelings and emotions, we can develop coping strategies that may not always be healthy and can potentially be harmful. We might do this to express emotional pain, to numb emotional pain, to feel something different or to regain a sense of control. Think about what you do to help you cope and how that coping strategy works for you. Considering this will make it easier to think of alternatives that may be safer and offer the same relief. SUGGESTIONS FOR COPING STRATEGIES Eat something sour or bitter - try lemons, limes or fizzy sour sweets Try the '5,4,3,2,1 technique' to regain some focus - think of 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell and 1 you can taste Hold something cold or warm and focus on the feeling of the sensation on your skin Focus on your breathing - think about the cool air entering your nostrils and the sensation of your chest rising and falling Slap a hard surface Play with putty, blue tack or modelling clay Cover your hands in glue, wait for it to dry then peel it off Give yourself a hand and foot massage Spend time with your pet - stroke them or groom them Give someone a compliment - see if you can make someone smile. TO REGAIN FEELING TO FEEL IN CONTROL Make a to-do list and break your day into small manageable chunks Look around the room and find something to touch or smell. If there's someone at home, call out to them and listen for their response Do a task where you usually feel in control. This can help you gain a sense of achievement - try cleaning, researching your favourite music artist or someone you admire, word searches or computer games Reflect on the last 7 days and write down things you have achieved, people you have seen and moments you feel happy Say the alphabet out loud or count out loud to 100 Build something using Lego if you have any or build a fort/den using things around you. EMOTIONAL RELEASE Shout or scream, out loud if there's no one around or into a pillow to muffle the sound Punch a punchbag or pillow if you don't have one Join a combat style exercise class or martial arts class Throw eggs or ice cubes at an outside wall and watch them smash Keep your recycling to one side and spend time flattening cartons, containers and boxes Watch something you know will make you laugh Buy a roll of bubble wrap and pop it or stamp on it Ball up a newspaper or magazine, sheet by sheet. Write down how you are feeling - arrange the emotions into lyrics or poetry or write a story about yourself in the 3rd person Write a letter with the aim to help others understand how you are feeling - give it to someone if you feel confident enough to share it Put a blindfold on and draw whatever comes into your mind Make yourself a mood chart or a mood diary to keep track of how you are feeling. Keep it on your bedroom door to let those close to you understand how you are Write down negative feelings and thoughts and challenge them - what makes them seem true? Why might they be false? - If one of your friends or family members had these thoughts, what advice would you give them? What would you say to cheer them up. TO EXPRESS OR COMMUNICATE When trying out new coping strategies make sure you are safe. For example, ensure you have no allergies to any foods/materials suggested and that you clean and tidy up to prevent any hazardous accidents, for yourself and others. These coping strategies are a starting point to help you consider what may be helpful to try short-term. If you would like to learn more about getting help longterm, speak to your GP, family and friends or a Suicide Prevention Adviser at HOPELINEUK.

212,1,"BEREAVEMENT When someone you love dies - it can be completely devastating. Everyone will be affected by bereavement at some point in their life and it can be an incredibly tough and overwhelming time. HOPELINEUK speaks to many young people who tell us that they feel suicidal after experiencing a bereavement. So we have put together some information about bereavement, how it can feel and what kind of help is available. How does it feel? There is no right or wrong way to feel when someone you love dies. You may have good days as well as bad days. There's no set time frame for grief - it is a lifelong process. Your emotions might be quite powerful and overwhelming sometimes and yet, at other times, you may feel distant or numb. Common feelings associated with bereavement can be shock, fear, overwhelming sadness, anger, numbness, guilt or even relief - especially if you've seen a loved one suffer for a period of time. All of these feelings are understandable and normal reactions. Some bereavement and loss experts suggest that there are four stages of grief: accepting your loss is real, experiencing the pain of grief, adjusting to life without your loved one and, in time, putting less energy and time into grief and more into another aspect of your life. You may well experience all of these things at some point but not necessarily in a specific order. Grief can leave you feeling all over the place. In time though, these feelings can become less intense. What can I do to help myself? ? Sit with the pain. After a significant loss, the pain can seem unbearable. Especially at first. We may feel like we're not coping, or that things will never get better. It's really important to allow ourselves to experience the pain, so that we can heal from it. Grief can often be thought of as part of a restorative or healing process. By pushing the pain away, and not allowing ourselves to confront it, we can experience it again at a later time. Some prefer this approach as it allows them to delay the pain for the time being and address other life factors. Sometimes, delaying the grieving process can be therapeutic but, inevitably, a time will come when you may feel like you are at a stage to handle certain emotions. By using support and acknowledging that things may take time to feel okay again you will be better able to cope with a loss, and less likely to develop unhealthy coping strategies that may put you at risk. ? Let it out. It's important to be able to express what we really feel. It's okay to not feel okay - and it's okay to cry. Being able to release your emotions and allow yourself to genuinely feel what you feel can help in the long and short term. ? Reach out for help. There's a popular saying that goes: ""a problem shared is a problem halved"". This idea is relevant when it comes to loss - reaching out to people who are compassionate and empathic can be truly healing. It is also important that we avoid those who do not empathise or offer compassion. There are a number of specialised services who offer this support depending on the type of loss a person has experienced. ? Don't blame yourself. Often, after experiencing a bereavement, some people reflect on what happened to cause this or what went wrong. This reflection can sometimes lead to feelings of guilt and can impact your self-esteem. It is important not to get consumed by this guilt, to remember that death is a natural part of life and that one individual cannot take full responsibility for what has happened. Also, it is natural to sometimes feel happy after a loss, even though we are also experiencing pain at the same time - and that's okay! ? Give it time. Bereavement can be like a rollercoaster. It's going to take time for things to feel different. How long will depend on many things - most importantly the significance of the loss to you, not other people. Gradually though, feelings may change and you will adapt. Life might not be the same as before - you may experience other losses related to the bereavement - but time will make a difference. We may also need to take time to reflect, to appreciate what has changed. This kind of reflection can often bring a whole new level of perspective for some, and can even be a positive to take away from the grieving process. ? Look after yourself. Take time to be kind to yourself. Take time off work if you need to or have a break. Engage in an activity that you enjoy; something that feels do-able and manageable. If you need to talk about the person who's died - that is okay and sometimes it's really important too. You may notice things feel harder on the anniversary of someone's death or perhaps on the birthday of the person who has died. If something like this is coming up and it's making you feel vulnerable, plan ahead and take time to look after yourself. When supporting someone else If you are supporting someone else through bereavement don't diminish their feelings or try and fix things. Give them space. Listen and allow them to talk freely. This will help them feel heard and less alone. It's not your job to fix everything - just being with someone can be very valuable and comforting. Where can I get help from? Bereavement can be incredibly painful and difficult to go through. While the pain from a bereavement is totally natural and understandable, it is not always easy to live with. There are lots of different services and options if you want to talk to someone about loss and bereavement. While being bereaved and experiencing grief isn't an illness, your GP might be able to offer you some help. Your GP might be able to refer you for a service like counselling or prescribe medication if appropriate. You don't need to see your doctor to access help as there are lots of different services that offer help. The list below outlines some different services that are available for you.

215,1,"SELF-HARM What is self-harm? The term 'self-harm' usually refers to someone intentionally causing themselves harm. Self-harm is often a physical response to emotional pain and/or intolerable experiences. It can also include self-neglect and engaging in risk-taking behaviour. Self-harm has a function for every individual who self-harms and stopping is not always straightforward even when you want to. Whether you are someone who self-harms, or you care about someone who self-harms, the following information is intended to shed some light on, what can be, a highly-stigmatised and complex subject. What causes someone to self-harm? For many young people self-harm is used as a coping mechanism. However, it's important to remember that everyone's reasons for self-harming are individual to them. Control, release, punishment, compulsion and expression are just a selection of reasons as to why someone may injure themselves. Sometimes, self-harm can also be a reaction to overwhelming life events that may feel unmanageable e.g. traumatic experiences in childhood such as abuse. I am concerned about someone self-harming - what can I do? In some situations there are clear signs that a young person is self-harming, at other times it can be harder to tell. If you think someone you care for is harming themselves, we encourage you to reach out to them. It's not always an easy conversation to have - but we recommend: ? Asking sensitively and directly if they have been harming themselves ? Managing your reactions and remaining calm ? Exploring the reasons behind their self-harm ? Listening to their explanation ? Trying to understand what's happening from their point of view ? Avoiding taking control of the situation ? Encouraging them to seek support I am someone who uses self-harm - what can I do? The more you understand your own self-harm, the more you can feel in control and hopefully less distressed. Understanding why you self-harm may help you talk about it with others too. There are steps you can take to ensure that you are safe and supported. Taking control of your self-harm can be really challenging - but we suggest: ? Considering what self-harm does for you and the role of it in your life ? Looking for patterns in your self-harm and keeping a diary ? Exploring possible alternative coping mechanisms and distraction techniques ? Caring for your injuries by accessing medical attention when needed and keeping a first-aid kit ? Reaching out to someone you trust and talking things through ? Getting some professional support in place by talking to your GP, a helpline or a young person's counselling service ? Remembering that things can change for you - there is HOPE Self-harm and suicide Self-harm is a struggle often shared with our Suicide Prevention Advisers at HOPELINEUK. More than half of people who die by suicide have a history of self-harm (NHS 2018). Self-harm may, or may not, be a sign that someone is feeling suicidal - it is very important to ask and not make assumptions. If you are a young person having thoughts of suicide - or you are concerned about a young person who may be suicidal - you can call HOPELINEUK on 0800 068 41 41 for practical advice and support. Myths and facts Myth: Young people who self-harm are just looking for attention. Fact: The phrase 'attention-seeking' dismisses the real reasons causing someone to injure themselves. Consider what's being communicated. Myth: It's just a phase - they'll grow out of it. Fact: Self-harm can affect any person at any age and is not something that only young people struggle with. There are many myths about self-injury. The best way to understand and support someone is to talk to them directly, being clear you are not judging them or trying to make decisions for them.

223,1,"Depression
 
 Definition
 
 Depression is a type of mood disorder. It is a serious illness characterized by intense and prolonged feelings of sadness, apathy and/or low energy.
 
 Think about mood as if it were a sliding scale: If someone feels ""stuck"" in a very low mood for a prolonged amount of time, or finds it hard to feel content or happy for any length of time, they might have depression.
 
 Depression can make you think, feel and behave in a way that interferes with your ability to live your best life. It can affect relationships, lead to lost time from work or school, or in severe cases, lead to suicide.
 
 Depression isn't the same as feeling sad or experiencing grief. Sadness and grief are normal responses to the inevitable losses and disappointments in daily life, but depression is more than being sad or feeling grief after a loss. It is not something someone can ""snap out"" of. Often there is no obvious reason why it happens to someone.
 
 At any given time, almost three million Canadians (or about 10%) have serious depression, and it is one of the leading causes of disability.
 
 It is not:
 
 ? ""Just a phase"" or something someone can ""snap out of"".
 
 ? A sign or result of low intelligence or weakness.
 
 ? Always caused by an event or definitive ""reason"".
 
 Causes
 
 There is no single cause of depression. The more risk factors a person has, the more at risk they are for developing it.
 
 Like all mental health issues, depression is complicated and can be caused or triggered by any combination of factors:
 
 * Biological - family history, brain development, etc.
 
 * Psychological - trauma, ongoing stress, etc.
 
 * Environmental factors - life events, unhealthy relationships, big changes (becoming a new parent, moving, death of a loved one, etc.).
 
 Signs and Symptoms
 
 Below is a list of signs and symptoms for depression. They can be explained by a number of factors or other illnesses, and anyone at some point or another may feel or behave in these ways whether they have a mental health issue or not. You may see behaviours and feelings described here that everyone has at times.
 
 Depression can change how you feel physically, your thinking, your emotions and your behaviour.
 
 Important: There are a wide range of symptoms that a person can experience when they have depression, and each person may experience them differently. Two different people could have the disorder, but experience it completely differently. No two people are the same.
 
 Physical Changes:
 
 * Reduced energy, becoming easily tired.
 
 * Feeling less active or not active at all.
 
 * Changes in weight and appetite - eating too little or too much.
 
 * Irritability or restlessness.
 
 * Sleep disturbances - trouble sleeping, or sleeping too much.
 
 * Stomach or digestion problems.
 
 * Loss of interest in sex.
 
 * Physical symptoms with no physical cause (e.g. headaches, muscle aches and pains, etc.).
 
 Changes in Thinking:
 
 * Difficulty thinking, concentrating or remembering.
 
 * Difficulty making decisions, avoiding making decisions.
 
 * Thoughts of being a failure, critical or judgemental toward oneself.
 
 * Obsessive thoughts, sense of impending doom or disaster, feeling like something bad is going to happen.
 
 * Persistent thoughts of death, suicide or attempts to hurt oneself.
 
 Changes in Feeling:
 
 * Depressed/low mood, intense sadness or frequent crying.
 
 * Loss of interest in activities that were once a source of pleasure.
 
 * Loss of interest and enjoyment in work, hobbies, people.
 
 * Decreased interest in and enjoyment from sex.
 
 * Feelings of uselessness, hopelessness, excessive guilt, and worthlessness.
 
 * Feeling numb, empty or an absence of feelings.
 
 * Feeling detached from life or others.
 
 * Reduced confidence and self-esteem.
 
 * Impatience, anger and aggressive feelings, even over small matters.
 
 Changes in Behaviour:
 
 * Social isolation, withdrawal from work, school, friends, hobbies.
 
 * Neglecting duties such as homework, housework, paying bills, etc.
 
 * Decrease in physical activity and exercise.
 
 * Decrease in self-care (e.g. not showering, grooming, eating etc.).
 
 * Self-harming behaviours and/or risky behaviour (e.g. reckless driving, unprotected sex, etc.).
 
 * Increased use of alcohol or drugs (prescription and/or non-prescription).
 
 * Aggressive, abusive or controlling behaviour.
 
 Note: There are subtypes of depression that present with similar symptoms. Seasonal affective disorder describes depression-like symptoms that appear in a seasonal pattern (often in winter months) and persistant depressive disorder (formerly called dysthymia) is a form of depression that is long-lasting and often not as ""intense"" as major depression, but which can also greatly affect a person's ability to feel content or happy.
 
 Help
 
 Depression is treatable. For depression or any other mental health concern, if signs or symptoms are interfering with your life in any way, or you're just feeling like you are in distress or feeling low, it's time to seek help. You don't need to wait until things get really ""bad"" before you seek help.
 
 For instance, if sleep patterns, eating, relationships, school, work, or enjoyment of life are being affected, it's a good idea to talk to someone. That someone could be a friend you trust, a teacher, your family doctor, a crisis line, or counsellor.
 
 If it is a friend you are concerned about, they may resist help or not even recognize that they need it. They might need you to make the first step.
 
 As always, if you feel like your friend might hurt him/herself or someone else, it's time to call emergency services. 
 
 Visit the Help Section to find out how to get help for yourself or a friend.
 
 Treatment
 
 Like other mental health issues, depression and how it is experienced will differ from person to person. Because each case is unique, the treatment will likely be unique for each individual.
 
 Treatment for depression may include a combination of strategies. Most often, a treatment strategy will include trying medication paired with psychotherapy. Individual or group counselling may also be helpful. Some people may need to spend time in a hospital for depression, while others may find outpatient clinics more helpful.
 
 Sometimes, while a person is living with depression, part of the treatment might be about treating individual symptoms on a temporary or ongoing basis to make someone feel more comfortable while they try to get better. For instance, if someone with depression is having trouble sleeping, a doctor might suggest treatment strategies to help that person get some sleep.
 
 Family members of someone who has depression may participate in therapy, support groups or benefit from learning about it and ways to support their loved one at home.
 
 Every story is different, and sometimes people need to try different types of supports before they find the right plan for them.
 
 A person living with depression, like any other person, will benefit from maintaining wellness and having good supports in their life. 
 
 Myths
 
 Depression is sometimes misunderstood by people who don't have direct experience with it. Because everyone feels ""low"" from time to time, people who don't have depression might get it mixed up with sadness or grief, feelings that are a normal part of life. Some common myths about depression are: 
 
 Myth: Depression means feeling sad all the time.
 
 Fact: Depression isn't the same as sadness, and people who have depression don't always feel ""sad"". Sometimes depression shows itself through anger, worry, aggression, or apathy (not feeling or caring about anything). These feelings may come and go. Sometimes people who have depression may even seem ""fine"" to family and friends.
 
 Myth: Depression is all in your head. People who have depression just need to cheer up and stop being so negative.
 
 Fact: Telling someone with depression to ""just cheer up"" is like telling someone with poor eyesight to just try harder to see better. It just doesn't work that way. There are factors at play when someone has Depression that make it very difficult or impossible to have or maintain a ""good mood"" or feel positive without help. Depression is a treatable illness.
 
 Myth: Postpartum depression is normal and not a real illness.
 
 Fact: Becoming a new parent is a major life event. When you pair that with lack of sleep, high expectations, massive hormonal changes and anxiety, feeling sad, lonely and overwhelmed can happen to anyone (whether you're a mom or a dad). However, for some new parents, these ""baby blues"" can progress into a serious mental illness that requires support and treatment. Postpartum depression and anxiety are nothing to be ashamed of and are real health issues that are generally very treatable.
 
 Myth: If a person is depressed, there has to be a reason.
 
 Fact: Depression is complicated. For some, it can seemingly come out of nowhere with no clear ""reason"". There doesn't have to be a reason or event to cause depression. Sometimes it just happens.
 
 Myth: If someone is depressed, they'll be depressed their whole life.
 
 Fact: In most cases, depression lasts for a limited period. Treatment can lead to a full recovery. Some cases may need ongoing management, but not all.
 
 Myth: There is no need to go to a medical doctor for treatment. Depression can be cured by will power, a holiday, or a great night of partying.
 
 Fact: Will power cannot cure depression. A depressed person experiencing lack of pleasure in their surroundings will not likely enjoy their holidays either. Alcohol may worsen the depression. Depression should be treated by a doctor and social support from family, friends and community.
 
 Myth: When a person with depression talks about suicide, they don't really mean it.
 
 Fact: Not all people with depression attempt suicide, but suicide is a risk when someone is depressed. Most people who are thinking of suicide say something about it before attempting it. If someone you know, whether you know them to be depressed or not, is talking about suicide, take them seriously.
 
 Myth: People who ""have it all""- a supportive family, wealth, power, etc. are not likely to develop depression.
 
 Fact: Though poverty or family issues may be contributing factors for depression, it can affect people across all social and economic levels. Many rich and famous people have been known to have depression. The causes vary, and can have nothing to do with how much money you have or how great your family is.
 
 Myth: If I have depression, I'm going to have to go to the hospital.
 
 Fact: For some, spending time in a hospital for serious depression is part of the treatment strategy and can be tremendously helpful. There's nothing wrong with that! Others will never have to go to the hospital, as therapy, medication, group counselling or other strategies may be enough to help someone get better. 
 
 Support
 
 Supporting someone with any type of serious illness can be challenging. Ways to help and support a friend or loved one who is living with depression:
 
 * Know the signs and symptoms of depression
 
 * Encourage professional help for your friend when needed (see Help Section)
 
 * If your friend is in the hospital, go and visit them if you are able. The hospital may be scary and overwhelming for them and a friendly face can help. Make sure to ask about visitor rules first.
 
 * Help your friend to avoid triggers like substances or situations that can cause them to relapse or feel unwell.
 
 * Treatment is a process. Medications and therapy can take time to help. Be aware of this and try to be supportive as your friend adjusts.
 
 * Be a sounding board. Listening without judgement and without trying to ""fix"" their problems can be incredibly helpful.
 
 * Stay calm and don't take things personally. Sometimes depression can really distort how someone perceives conversations or situations. How someone reacts or communicates when they have depression may be confusing, distressing or even hurtful at times. They may be feeling overwhelmed and acting out, and it's probably not about you.
 
 * Ask your friend how else you can help. It may be as easy as just providing a distraction, asking them to do simple, relaxing things with you (like hanging out, watching a movie etc.).
 
 * Some people need time to themselves, while others might need to spend time with people. Be supportive and try to resist the temptation to tell them what you think they need to do.
 
 * Set some boundaries for yourself, and take care. You can't help someone if you're feeling overwhelmed yourself.

 Definition
 
 Grief, also sometimes called bereavement, is a hard thing to define. Most often we think of grief as being an emotional response to the death of a loved one, but sometimes grief happens because of other types of major losses, life changes or transitions. Grief is a natural response to loss, not a disorder or illness (unless it's complicated by other factors).
 
 You might describe grief as being in a state of very low mood. Think about mood as if it were a sliding scale: If someone feels ""stuck"" in a very low mood for a prolonged amount of time, or finds it hard to feel content or happy for any length of time after experiencing loss, they might be grieving. Grief might also cause a person to feel anger, shock, guilt, disbelief, despair or numbness. Grief isn't just about feeling something emotionally. Grief can also affect our thoughts, actions and bodies.
 
 Grief is a part of life. At some point, everyone will experience loss, and grief is a natural response to loss, not a disorder or illness. Someone who is grieving can go through a series of emotional phases as they work through their feelings and learn ways to move ahead and cope.
 
 For most, grief is temporary. This doesn't necessarily mean that people ""get over"" the loss; the loss of someone close to you will be felt in some way forever. It does mean, however, that the pain and low mood that grief brings usually lessens over time. Because we will all experience loss at some point, coping with grief is a vital part of our mental health.
 
 It's tricky to decide how long grief should last, and there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to grieve. When someone has a loss, they may grieve in some way for the rest of their life.
 
 Sometimes the grieving process is prolonged and turns into ""chronic"" or ""complicated"" grief. Complicated grief might be triggered by the circumstances of the loss (like death by suicide, a sudden or unexpected illness or accident, or after a long and painful illness), by life experiences (like lack of support from family or friends, or if a person is also dealing with other mental or physical health issues). The grief process might also be prolonged if the loss causes a big life change for a person (if someone was very dependent on a parent, for instance, and that parent dies) or the loss changes their identity somehow (the loss of physical or cognitive ability, or the loss of a child). The medical term sometimes used to describe prolonged or complicated grief is persistent complex bereavement disorder.
 
 Grief is not:
 
 ? Something someone can ""snap out of""
 
 ? A sign or result of low intelligence or weakness
 
 ? The same for everyone
 
 Causes
 
 Grief is caused by a loss of some sort. Typically, we think of grief as being a response to a death, but it can also be caused by other types of loss or transition (loss of a home or life you were used to, the loss of culture or identity, loss of an important relationship, loss of physical health or ability etc.).
 
 Someone's ability to cope with loss is going to be determined by a number of factors, and is very much connected to the circumstances of the loss, their overall mental health, the level of support they have in their life and how resilient they are. Culture, age, circumstances, life experiences etc. will all be factors in how someone grieves.
 
 Mental health and resiliency are generally affected by any and all of the following factors:
 
 * Biological - family history, brain development, etc.
 
 * Psychological - trauma, ongoing stress, etc.
 
 * Physical - ongoing sickness, hormones, substance use, etc.
 
 * Environmental factors - life events, relationships, support network, etc.
 
 Signs and Symptoms
 
 No two people will grieve in the exact same way. The process of grieving will differ according to the circumstance of the loss, the person and their culture. The signs and symptoms listed here can be explained by a number of factors or illnesses. Many signs of grief are similar to the signs or symptoms of depression, but grief is not an illness.
 
 Only if these symptoms are excessive, go on for a longer period of time than is ""typical"", and interfere with normal everyday functioning will grief be seen as problematic or ""complicated"".
 
 There are a number of feelings that people experience while coming to terms with a loss, and these feelings can come in ""waves"" or appear to happen in ""phases"":
 
 * Shock, numbness, bewilderment, a sense of disbelief, denial.
 
 * Feelings of emptiness or intense suffering.
 
 * Dreams and/or hallucinations that their loved one is still alive.
 
 * Feelings of despair as one comes to terms with the loss.
 
 * Feelings of sadness; the inability to feel pleasure.
 
 * Tense, restless anxiety may alternate with lethargy and fatigue.
 
 * Individuals may alternate between avoiding reminders of the deceased and reclaiming memories.
 
 * Self-blame for treating the deceased badly.
 
 * Feelings of sadness may also be complicated by feelings of relief, fear, guilt, anger, etc.
 
 Physical symptoms of grief can include:
 
 * Weakness
 
 * Sleep disturbances
 
 * Loss of appetite or overeating
 
 * Headaches
 
 * Back pain
 
 * Indigestion
 
 * Shortness of breath
 
 * Heart palpitations
 
 * Occasional dizziness and nausea
 
 Changes in Thinking
 
 * Cognition is slowed down, difficulty thinking, concentrating or remembering.
 
 * Difficulty making decisions, avoiding making decisions.
 
  Changes in Behaviour
 
 * Social isolation, withdrawal from work, school, friends, hobbies, etc.
 
 * Neglecting duties such as homework, housework, paying bills, etc.
 
 * Decrease in physical activity and exercise.
 
 * Decrease in self care (not showering, grooming, eating, etc.).
 
 * Increased use of alcohol or drugs (prescription and/or non-prescription).
 
 Help
 
 Grief is a part of life. At some point, everyone will experience loss. Grief is a natural response to this loss, not a ""disorder' or ""illness"". Someone who is grieving can go through a series of emotional phases as they work through their feelings and learn ways to move ahead and cope.
 
 The way someone recognizes a death in the family or any type of loss will be different for each person, culture and/or circumstance:
 
 Most cultures have a way of recognizing a loss through a celebration of life or funeral practice. Recognizing a death with family and community by participating in some type of ritual or cultural practice can be useful in helping someone through a loss and finding a sense of closure. Sometimes a person's faith or community of worship is integral to how someone thinks about and deals with loss.
 
 Connection with others can help someone when they are experiencing loss. This could be informal, like spending time with family, friends or community or in the form of an organized support or bereavement group. For some, however, bereavement groups might not be helpful or might make someone focus too heavily on their loss. Every person is different.
 
 Moving forward with ""regular life"" can help someone move through loss. Returning to work or school (when ready) or resuming hobbies and social life can help someone feel productive and learn to adjust their life after a loss. For others, a break from ""regular life"" is needed for a time in order to process and cope, so taking time off from work or school can be helpful.  
 
 If the grieving process seems particularly intense or doesn't seem to be resolving itself over time, it's a good idea to talk to someone. That someone could be a friend you trust, a teacher, your family doctor, a crisis line, or counsellor.
 
 If you feel like your friend might hurt themself or someone else, it's time to call emergency services.
 
 Visit the Help Section to find out how to get help for yourself or a friend.
 
 Treatment
 
 Formal psychological help usually isn't used unless someone is experiencing complicated grief. In this case, psychotherapy might be helpful for someone to resume daily activities and work through feelings like anger, regret or guilt in order to heal.
 
 For some, complicated grief can turn into or complicate mood or anxiety disorders, in which case a person might need more or different treatment to deal with the symptoms and causes of those illnesses.
 
 Every story is different, and sometimes people need to try different types of supports before they find the right plan for them.
 
 If it is a friend you are concerned about, they may resist help or not even recognize that they need it. They might need you to make the first step.
 
 A person experiencing grief, like any other person, will benefit from maintaining wellness and having good supports in their life.
 
 Myths
 
 Myth: Grief has a definite ending point. You should be done grieving after about a year.
 
 Fact: Grief doesn't run on a schedule and everyone experiences and copes with grief differently. While you may get through the initial, more intense period of grief or bereavement and resume ""regular life"" after a while, it doesn't mean the loss isn't still felt. Certain holidays or anniversaries, situations, objects or settings may create a wave of emotion and grief over a loss, even if the loss happened years ago. There are instances where people do seem to grieve intensely for a prolonged period of time, and it starts to interfere with or complicate their life or health (sometimes referred to as complicated grief or persistent complex bereavement disorder), but this isn't simply diagnosed based on a set number of weeks or months someone has been grieving. It is determined by how the grief is affecting a person's life.
 
 Myth: The length of time and intensity you grieve for a loved one is a direct reflection of how much you loved them or how close to them you were.
 
 Fact: While it's true that losing people that are close to you (a parent, partner, sibling or child) can be particularly hard, how someone grieves the loss of a loved one is likely going to depend on their personality, their life experiences, their age, their culture, the circumstances around the loss etc. Some may lose someone very close to them and seem to resume regular life fairly quickly. This doesn't mean they didn't love their friend or family member - it might mean that they have coped with the loss in their own way or find returning to work, school or hobbies comforting. For others, the loss of someone, even if they weren't that close to them or had a strained relationship with them, can affect them much more and for longer than expected. There is no right or wrong way to grieve.
 
 Myth: Grief is about feeling sadness.
 
 Fact: Feeling a loss is often about feeling intensely sad. But it is often more complicated than that. Sometimes people feel shocked, angry, guilty, regretful, scared, numb or even relieved. For instance, losing a parent can affect your financial stability, causing one to feel uncertain and worried on top of feeling sad for their loss. Someone else might lose someone after a long and painful illness, causing them to feel relief that the illness is finally over. Someone who has lost physical ability due to an accident might feel sad but also angry or scared as they figure out how to adjust their life. There is no right or wrong way to feel while grieving. How someone feels while grieving can change over time or depend on the circumstances of the loss.
 
 Myth: Grief won't last as long as you avoid talking about or thinking about the loss. Grieving alone and in silence is better.
 
 Fact: While this may work for some in the short term, most often if there's a way to process the loss - by talking, thinking, writing, etc. about it - it can help to process feelings. Reaching out to someone that will listen and help you through it can really help.  
 
 Support
 
 Supporting someone through their grief can feel uncertain or challenging. It is easy to feel like you're doing or saying the wrong thing, or feel helpless because you want to help but don't know how.
 
 Here are some possible ways to help and support a friend or loved one who is grieving:
 
 * Be reassuring and sympathetic company and a good listener. Listen without judging and resist the urge to try and ""fix"" their problems for them.
 
 * Offer specific support. Saying something like ""if there's anything I can do, let me know"" is always done with the best intention, but it puts the responsibility on the grieving person to reach out and ask for help. Instead try ""I'm going to drop by tomorrow with some groceries"", ""I'm going to call you in a few days and we'll go catch a movie"" or ""how about we go for a walk tomorrow?"" might be more effective, because they are specific plans to help or connect.
 
 * Saying ""God has a plan..."" or ""time heals..."" when someone is experiencing a significant loss may not be helpful. It might be said or thought with the best intentions, but it could also make someone feel like their feelings aren't validated or appropriate. It's ok for people to feel angry or sad when they lose something/someone and have their feelings validated.
 
 * Discouraging expressions of grief or shutting off discussions about the person who died is not helpful, because these things are part of the healing process for a lot of people. Don't worry- talking about the loss isn't going to ""remind"" them, because the loss is likely not far from their thoughts anyway. Sharing stories of the person who died or the times in the past before the loss can actually be very comforting and help someone move forward.
 
 * Reassuring someone that their feelings are valid and normal is a very supportive thing to do. Don't judge a person because they aren't thinking, feeling or behaving in the same way you would. They need to feel and express themselves in their own way.
 
 * Grief is often bigger than the loss. For instance, if someone loses a parent, there might be other stresses felt around financial support, family roles or security.
 
 * Keep including your friend in your life and social activities. Don't always assume that they want to be alone or with family. Invite them out to dinner of coffee or for a walk. They might say ""no"", but they'll probably appreciate the offer.
 
 * If you feel like your friend needs extra support or that their grief is prolonged or intense enough that it is interfering with their life, try connecting them to some services in your area for support (see Help Section).
 
 * Stay calm and don't take things personally. Sometimes grief can really  affect how someone reacts or communicates, which can be confusing, distressing or even hurtful at times. They may be feeling overwhelmed and acting out, and it's probably not about you.
 
 * Some people need time to themselves, while others might need to spend time with people. Be supportive and try to resist the temptation to tell them what you think they need to do.
 
 * Set some boundaries for yourself, and take care. You can't help someone if you're feeling overwhelmed yourself.

 Definition
 
 Mood: A temporary state of mind or feeling.
 
 Everyone has ""moods"", high and low, and this is a good thing. A person's mood can change from day to day or multiple times in a day, and be affected by any number of things: events, interactions with other people, good or bad news, how much you've eaten or exercised, the weather, how much sleep you got etc.
 
 If you imagine mood to be like a sliding scale, with zero being the lowest mood possible (profound grief or numbness), and 10 being the highest mood (mania or euphoria), people typically move up and down the middle portion of this scale.
 
 Some of us might spend more time in the lower part of the scale, while others might typically rest somewhere in the higher end. There is a wide range of ""normal"" when it comes to mood, and a healthy person typically experiences a healthy range of moods. Highs and lows are a normal part of life.
 
 If someone has a mood disorder, however, it means that there is an issue with how they are experiencing moods. It might mean that they are ""stuck"" in a low mood (depression), or that they seem to swing between the mood extremes (bipolar disorder) for no obvious reason. Someone with a mood disorder might find it hard to maintain a higher mood for any length of time and/or not be able to pinpoint or explain why their mood is low, as it seems to be out of their control. It can be extremely disruptive to a person's life, and affect relationships, employment, school, family, goals etc.
 
 Mood disorders are common mental health issues. They describe a wide range of issues and symptoms, and each person may experience a mood disorder differently. Here is a list of some more common mood disorders, but it's important to remember that most people don't fit neatly into a ""category"": 
 
 Types of Mood Disorders
 
 Depression (major depressive disorder): When someone has intense and ongoing feelings of sadness, apathy and low energy they might have a form of depression. Depression can cause a disturbance in thoughts, feelings, behaviours and physical health that can limit your quality of life, affect relationships and limit your ability to get things done. Depression is more than being sad or feeling grief after a loss. There are subtypes of depression, like seasonal affective disorder (see below), dysthymia (a longer lasting and sometimes less ""intense"" form of major depression) or postpartum depression (a mood disorder associated with becoming a new parent). Information on depression.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD): When someone has episodes of depression that have a pattern of happening during a certain time of year (usually in winter) where the symptoms seem to go away after the season is over, they might have seasonal affective disorder. Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression and is also referred to as 'seasonal depression,' 'winter depression,' or 'major depression with a seasonal pattern.'. Information on SAD.
 
 Bipolar disorder: If someone has an ongoing pattern of experiencing polar opposites of mood - like cycling between extremely high mood (mania or manic stage), followed by an extremely low mood (depressive stage), they might have a form of bipolar disorder. The changes in mood can be sudden, and are extreme enough that they interfere with a person's ability to live their life.There are often periods of stability between episodes, and the frequency and speed of mood changes will be different for each person and the type of disorder they have. Information on bipolar.
 
 Mood disorders are not:
 
 ? Simply feeling sad or low - everyone feels sad or low at times.
 
 ? The result of any actions or personal failures of the individual.
 
 ? A sign or result of low intelligence or weakness.
 
 ? All the same. Symptoms differ between disorders and people.
 
 Myths
 
 Mood disorders are sometimes misunderstood by people who don't have direct experience with them. Because everyone feels ""lows"" and ""highs"" from time to time, people who don't have a mood disorder might get them mixed up with feelings that are a normal part of life. Some common myths about mood disorders are: 
 
 Myth: Depression means feeling sad.
 
 Fact: Depression isn't the same as sadness, and people who have depression don't always feel ""sad"". Sometimes depression shows itself through anger, worry, aggression, or apathy (not feeling or caring about anything). These feelings may come and go. Sometimes people who have depression may even seem ""fine"" to family and friends.
 
 Myth: Mood disorders are all in your head. People who have a mood disorder just need to pull themselves together.
 
 Fact: Telling someone with any mental illness to ""pull themselves together"" is like telling someone with poor eyesight to just try harder to see. It just doesn't work that way. There are factors at play when someone has a mood disorder that make it very difficult or impossible to maintain or ""control"" their mood without help.
 
 Myth: If a person is depressed, there has to be a reason.
 
 Fact: Depression is complicated. For some, it can seemingly come out of nowhere with no clear ""reason"", while others may have specific triggers. There doesn't have to be an event or incident to cause depression. Sometimes it just happens.
 
 Myth: The manic phase of bipolar disorder is like feeling really happy, and is a nice break from feeling depressed.
 
 Fact: The manic phase is not ""fun"" for many people living with bipolar disorder. The elevated mood someone has when they are in a manic phase can be disruptive and destructive. Many people who experience it describe sleeplessness, risky behaviour and doing or saying things that they later regret. Sometimes, mania can show itself in the form of anger or irritability. The manic phase can prevent someone from going to work or school or create situations that put a strain on relationships. Mania is not the same as feeling ""really happy"".
 
 Myth: Mood disorders are lifelong.
 
 Fact: In most cases, depression lasts for a limited period, and other mood disorders like bipolar disorder can also be managed effectively. Treatment can lead to a full recovery. Some cases are life long, but not all. Statistically, mood disorders tend to improve as people grow older.
 
 Myth: There is no need to go to a medical doctor for treatment. Mood disorders can be cured by will power, a holiday, or a great night of partying.
 
 Fact: Will power cannot cure a mental illness. A depressed person experiencing lack of pleasure in their surroundings will not enjoy their holidays either. Substance use can worsen or complicate a mood disorder. Mood disorders are illnesses that should be treated by a doctor and social support from family, friends and community.
 
 Myth: When a person with a mood disorder talks about suicide, they don't really mean it.
 
 Fact: Not all people with mood disorders attempt suicide, but suicide is a risk when someone is struggling with their mood. Most people who are thinking of suicide say something about it before attempting it. If someone you know, whether you know them to be depressed or not, is talking about suicide, take them seriously.
 
 Myth: Postpartum depression is normal and not a real illness.
 
 Fact: Becoming a new parent is a major life event. When you pair that with lack of sleep, high expectations, massive hormonal changes and anxiety, feeling sad, lonely and overwhelmed can happen to anyone (whether you're a mom or a dad). However, for some new parents, these ""baby blues"" can progress into a serious mental illness that requires support and treatment. Postpartum depression and anxiety are nothing to be ashamed of and are real health issues that are generally very treatable.
 
 Myth: A good, healthy relationship can cure a mood disorder.
 
 Fact: Although social support is an important part of recovery, most of the time it will not cure a disorder on its own. Even if you are giving your all as a supporter, there might still be days your loved one will experience feelings of being not good enough, or as if no one cares about them. Remember that often, this is their illness talking, not them. Remember that no matter how great you are, you cannot cure an illness. Your support is probably really appreciated, even if it doesn't always feel that way or your friend can't communicate that to you clearly. They are not ill because you aren't ""good enough"". That being said, a good way to help is to listen, and learn as much as you can about the disorder and how you can help. There are lots of ways that you can support your friend through their recovery. You're not there to cure them; you're there to support them as they figure out their own path to recovery.
 
 Myth: People who ""have it all"" (e.g. a supportive family, wealth, power, etc.) are not likely to develop a mood disorder.
 
 Fact: Though poverty or family issues may be contributing factors for mood disorders, it can affect people across all social and economic levels. Many rich and famous people have been known to have a mood disorder. The causes vary, and can have nothing to do with how much money you have or how great your family is.
 
 Myth: If I have a mood disorder or any other mental illness, I'm going to have to go to the hospital.
 
 Fact: For some, spending time in a hospital for a mental illness is part of the treatment strategy and can be very helpful. There's nothing wrong with that! Others will never have to go to the hospital, as therapy, medication, group counselling or other strategies may be enough to help someone get better.
 
 Myth: I have mood swings sometimes. It must mean I have bipolar disorder.
 
 Fact: Healthy people experience a wide range of moods. Your mood is affected by all sorts of things, like what's going on in your life, interactions you have with people during the day, whether or not you've eaten or exercised, how much sleep you got last night etc. Having bipolar disorder is different, because the cycles of mood are often sudden and/or unexplainable, prolonged and extreme to the point where it gets in the way of life.

 Definition
 
 To define seasonal affective disorder (SAD), it's helpful to know what depression is first. Depression is a type of mood disorder. It is a serious illness characterized by intense and prolonged feelings of sadness, apathy and/or low energy. Think about mood as if it were a sliding scale: if someone feels ""stuck"" in a very low mood for a prolonged amount of time, or finds it hard to feel content or happy for any length of time, it might be depression.
 
 SAD is considered to be a sub-type of depression and is also called 'seasonal depression', 'winter depression' or 'major depression with a seasonal pattern'. When someone has recurring episodes of depression that start and end in a seasonal pattern (usually coinciding with winter), they might have SAD. 
 
 SAD isn't the same as feeling sad or experiencing grief. Sadness and grief are normal responses to the inevitable losses and disappointments in daily life, but having a form of depression is more than being sad or feeling grief after a loss. It is not something someone can ""snap out"" of.
 
 Often there is no obvious reason why depression happens to someone, but with seasonal affective disorder, it is triggered or made worse by the change of seasons.
 
 It is not:
 
 ? Just the ""winter blahs"".
 
 ? ""Just a phase"" or something someone can ""snap out of"".
 
 ? A sign or result of low intelligence or weakness.
 
 ? Always caused by an event or definitive ""reason"".
 
 Causes
 
 There is no single cause of SAD or any other mood disorder. The more risk factors a person has, the more at-risk they are for developing a mood disorder.
 
 One major risk factor for SAD is the region where a person lives. People that live far from the equator (either north or south) are more likely to get seasonal affective disorder, probably because these are the regions of the world that experience the most drastic changes from summer to winter.
 
 There are many ideas about how exactly the seasonal change causes a person to have SAD. In winter months, there is a decrease in sunlight which can upset a person's internal ""clock"" and cause a reduction in the brain chemicals associated with positive mood. Some people, however, experience their cycle of low mood in the spring and summer months, referred to as summer onset SAD. This is a much less common form of SAD, but is also thought to be connected to the change in sunlight hours that can throw off our body clock and mood.
 
 It could also have to do with the way our bodies and brains cope with cold temperatures, air pressure changes, and changes in activity levels (for instance, people may be more likely to stay indoors during winter months and be less active).
 
 So why do some people get SAD while others don't? Like all mental health issues, SAD is complicated and can be caused or triggered by any combination of factors:
 
 * Genetic - A family history of SAD or another form of depression increases risk.
 
 * Psychological - People who already have a mental illness are more likely to been impacted by seasonal changes and have SAD.
 
 * Biological - Someone with pre-existing low levels of vitamin D may be more susceptible to experiencing SAD.
 
 * Environmental factors - Living far away from the equator increases a person's risk for having SAD.
 
 Signs and Symptoms
 
 Below is a list of signs and symptoms for seasonal affective disorder. The following list should not be used to diagnose yourself or someone else. It is only intended to provide general information. If you think you might be experiencing a mental illness, you should see your doctor.
 
 These signs can be explained by a number of factors or other illnesses, and anyone at some point or another may feel or behave in these ways whether they have a mental health issue or not. You may see behaviours and feelings described here that everyone has at times.
 
 Depression can change how you feel physically, your thinking, your emotions and your behaviour, and with SAD, these changes are usually seen or made worse in a seasonal pattern.
 
 Important: There are a wide range of symptoms that a person can experience when they have a mood disorder like SAD, and each person may experience them differently. No two people are the same.
 
 Physical changes that happen in a seasonal pattern:
 
 * Reduced energy, becoming easily tired.
 
 * Feeling less active or not active at all.
 
 * Changes in weight and appetite (for fall/winter SAD, this typically manifests as overeating, craving carbs, and weight gain; for spring/summer SAD, this tends to manifest as a poor appetite and associated weight loss).
 
 * Irritability or restlessness.
 
 * Sleep disturbances (for fall/winter SAD, this typically manifests as oversleeping; for spring/summer SAD, this typically manifests as insomnia).
 
 * Stomach or digestion problems.
 
 * Physical symptoms with no physical cause (e.g. headaches, muscle aches and pains, etc.).
 
 * Symptoms reduce or disappear completely for at least two consecutive months when the season changes.
 
 Changes in thinking that happen in a seasonal pattern:
 
 * Thinking is slowed down, difficulty thinking, concentrating or remembering.
 
 * Difficulty making decisions, avoiding making decisions.
 
 * Thoughts of being a failure, critical or judgemental toward oneself.
 
 * Obsessive thoughts, sense of impending doom or disaster, feeling like something bad is going to happen.
 
 * Persistent thoughts of death, suicide or attempts to hurt oneself.
 
 * Symptoms reduce or disappear completely for at least two consecutive months when the season changes.
 
 Changes in feelings that happen in a seasonal pattern
 
 * Depressed/low mood, intense sadness or frequent crying.
 
 * Loss of interest in activities that were once a source of pleasure.
 
 * Loss of interest and enjoyment in work, hobbies, people.
 
 * Decreased interest in and enjoyment from sex.

 Help
 
 Seasonal affective disorder is treatable. For SAD or any other mental health concern, if signs or symptoms are interfering with your life in any way, or you're feeling like you are in distress, it's time to seek help. You don't need to wait until things get really ""bad"" before you seek help.
 
 For instance, if sleep patterns, eating, relationships, school, work, or enjoyment of life are being affected, it's a good idea to talk to someone. That someone could be a friend you trust, a teacher, your family doctor, a crisis line, or counsellor.
 
 If it is a friend you are concerned about, they may resist help or not even recognize that they need it. They might need you to make the first step.
 
 As always, if you feel like your friend might hurt themselves or someone else, it's time to call emergency services.
 
 Visit the Help Section to find out how to get help for yourself or a friend.
 
 Treatment
 
 Like other mental health issues, seasonal affective disorder and how it is experienced will differ from person to person. Because each case is unique, the treatment will likely be unique for each individual.
 
 Treatment for SAD may include a combination of strategies. One common form of treatment is light therapy. Light therapy consists of a person spending time in front of a special light that mimics sunlight as part of their daily routine. These lights can be purchased and then used at home, but it is best if you consult with a doctor first to make sure you are using the proper light and using it safely.
 
 Lifestyle changes/strategies might also include things like diet changes (making an effort to eat fresh fruits and veggies if available), spending time outdoors and regular exercise.
 
 Sometimes, while a person is living with SAD, part of the treatment might be about treating individual symptoms on a temporary or ongoing basis to make someone feel more comfortable while they try to get better. For instance, if someone is having trouble sleeping, a doctor might suggest treatment strategies to help that person sleep better.
 
 Medication can also be helpful to help stabilize someone enough to get the most out of therapy, counselling and living life. Every person is different, so if medication is used, it may take a while to find the medication that works best for you.
 
 Sometimes spending time in a treatment clinic or hospital is necessary, while for others, outpatient (getting help from a professional without having to actually ""stay over"" in a hospital) is better.
 
 If you have to wait to get an appointment, there are many places that offer support while you wait. Find out where to call in your area.
 
 Along with treatment from your doctor or therapist, there are things you can do to help and support your own recovery.
 
 Every story is different, and sometimes people need to try different types of supports before they find the right plan for them. Be patient, and don't give up.
 
 A person living with SAD, like any other person, will benefit from maintaining wellness and having good supports in their life. 
 
 Myths
 
 SAD and other mood disorders are sometimes misunderstood by people who don't have direct experience with it. Because everyone feels ""low"" from time to time, people who don't have seasonal affective disorder might get it mixed up with sadness, grief, or other feelings that are a normal part of life. Some common myths about SAD and other forms of depression are:
 
 Myth: Everyone feels a little low during the winter. The ""winter blues"" are the same as seasonal affective disorder.
 
 Fact: It's natural to feel a loss of energy in the winter months. It's common for people to go outside less, eat differently and feel more tired when the sunlight hours are shortened and the temperature drops. Most of the time, people can make themselves feel better with a little self care, like by exercising, going outside and getting a good night's sleep. People with SAD, however, experience intense symptoms and often need professional support and treatment strategies to cope.
 
 Myth: Seasonal affective disorder only happens in winter.
 
 Fact: The majority of people who have SAD experience their symptoms in the winter months. However, there is another much less common form of SAD where people's mood is affected in spring or summer. Many, but not all, of the symptoms of this form of SAD are quite similar to those of people who struggle in the winter.
 
 Myth: Depression means feeling sad all the time.
 
 Fact: Depression isn't the same as sadness, and people who have depression don't always feel ""sad"". Sometimes depression shows itself through anger, worry, aggression, or apathy (not feeling or caring about anything). These feelings may come and go. Sometimes people who have depression may even seem ""fine"" to family and friends.
 
 Myth: SAD and other mood disorders are all in your head. People who have SAD just need to cheer up, go outside and stop being so negative.
 
 Fact: Telling someone with SAD to ""just cheer up"" is like telling someone with poor eyesight to just try harder to see. It simply doesn't work that way. There are factors at play when someone has depression that make it very difficult, or impossible, to have or maintain a ""good mood"" or feel positive without help. SAD is a treatable illness.
 
 Myth: If someone has SAD, they'll have it for life.
 
 Fact: SAD varies, like any other mental illness, from person to person. Some people experience long breaks between SAD symptoms, while others continually need support every year. SAD, like depression, is treatable.
 
 Myth: There is no need to go to a medical doctor for treatment. Seasonal affective disorder can be cured by willpower, exercise, a walk outside or a great night of partying.
 
 Fact: Will power and lifestyle changes alone are rarely, if ever, able to ""cure"" SAD. Mood disorders are serious mental illnesses that require support and treatment.
 
 Myth: When a person with a mood disorder talks about suicide, they don't really mean it.
 
 Fact: Not all people with mood disorders like SAD attempt suicide, but suicide is a risk when someone is depressed. Most people who are thinking of suicide say something about it before attempting it. If someone you know, whether you know them to be depressed or not, is talking about suicide, take them seriously.
 
 Myth: People who ""have it all"" (a supportive family, wealth, power, etc.) are not likely to develop a mood disorder like SAD.
 
 Fact: The causes and risk factors for SAD vary, and have nothing to do with how much money you have or how great your family is. SAD is caused by a number of factors that are beyond a person's control and triggered by seasonal changes.
 
 Myth: If I have a mood disorder like SAD, I'm going to have to go to the hospital.
 
 Fact: For some, spending time in a hospital for serious depression is part of the treatment strategy and can be tremendously helpful. There's nothing wrong with that! Others will never have to go to the hospital, as psychotherapy, light therapy, medication, group counselling or other strategies may be enough to help someone get better when they have SAD. 
 
 Support
 
 Supporting someone with any type of serious illness can be challenging. Ways to help and support a friend or loved one who is living with seasonal affective disorder:
 
 * Know the signs and symptoms of depression and seasonal affective disorder.
 
 * Encourage habits and lifestyle changes that can support recovery, like eating healthy food, going outside every day and getting enough sleep, but know that these things along aren't likely to ""cure"" SAD on their own.
 
 * Encourage professional help for your friend when needed (see Help Section).
 
 * If your friend is in the hospital, go and visit them if you are able. The hospital may be scary and overwhelming for them, and a friendly face can help. Make sure to ask about visitor rules first.
 
 * Help your friend to avoid triggers like substances or situations that can cause them to relapse or feel unwell.
 
 * Treatment is a process. Medications and therapy can take time to help. Be aware of this and try to be supportive as your friend adjusts.
 
 * Be a sounding board. Listening without judgement and without trying to ""fix"" their problems can be incredibly helpful.
 
 * Stay calm and don't take things personally. Sometimes a depressed state can really distort how someone perceives conversations or situations. How someone reacts or communicates when they have depression may be confusing, distressing or even hurtful at times. They may be feeling overwhelmed and acting out, and it's probably not about you.
 
 * Ask your friend how else you can help. It may be as easy as just providing a distraction, asking them to do simple, relaxing things with you (like hanging out, watching a movie etc.).
 
 * Some people need time to themselves, while others might need to spend time with people. Be supportive and try to resist the temptation to tell them what you think they need to do.
 
 * Set some boundaries for yourself, and take care. You can't help someone if you're feeling overwhelmed yourself.

240,0,"Self-Harm
 
 Note: Self-harm is not a mental illness, but is common and associated with many different mental health concerns.
 
 Definition
 
 When someone purposely injures themselves and not necessarily with the intention of dying, this is self-harm. Self-harm is not a mental illness, but it is usually a sign that someone is struggling and in need of a way to cope.
 
 Important: People self-harm in different ways (cutting, burning, scratching, hitting, etc.) and for different reasons.
 
 ? To cope with anxiety or depression
 
 ? To cope with loss, trauma, violence, or other difficult situations
 
 ? To 'punish' themselves
 
 ? To turn emotional pain into physical pain
 
 ? To feel 'real' and counter feelings of emptiness or numbness
 
 ? To feel euphoria
 
 ? To regain control of their bodies
 
 ? To simply feel better                           -CMHA
 
 Self-harm and suicide attempts are not the same thing. Although someone who self-harms may have thoughts of suicide, self-harm is usually used as a way to cope. Suicide, on the other hand, usually happens when someone feels desperate and like they cannot cope any longer.
 
 One study of Canadian youth found that almost 2 out of every 10 youth aged 14-21 had hurt themselves on purpose at one time or another. Self-injury behaviours usually start between 13 and 15 years of age, and happen most often in teenagers and young adults. - Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario
 
 Self-harm is not:
 
 * ""Just"" a cry for attention.
 
 * A sign or result of low intelligence or weakness.
 
 Causes
 
 Self-harm is a behaviour that can occur among any person at any age, but is more common among young people. Because self-harm is used as a way to cope with numbness or overwhelming feelings, the causes of self-harm can be any number of things, like a stressful event, trauma, low self-esteem or mood, eating and/or anxiety disorders.
 
 Self-harm could start because of a single stressful or traumatic event, or develop over time because of an ongoing issue.
 
 Some people might self-harm because they feel numb or overwhelmed with feelings and need a physical pain release to cope. Some people might self-harm as a way to feel a sense of control when their life feels chaotic.
 
 Self-harm continues and becomes a pattern with some people. If someone feels some kind of relief from self-harming, it can be hard to stop the impulse to keep doing it. It can turn into a troubling cycle.
 
 Signs and Symptoms
 
 Some people who self-harm take great care to hide their injuries, while others are not concerned with hiding their injuries at all. Below is a list of signs that someone might be self-harming. Please note that these signs could be explained by a number of different issues, not just self-harm:
 
 * Unexplained frequent injuries, such as cuts and burns
 
 * Unexplained scars
 
 * Wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts all the time, even in warm weather
 
 * Low self-esteem and being highly self-critical
 
 * Problems handling emotions (tearful, moody, angry outbursts, etc.)
 
 * Withdrawing from activities, friends, family
 
 Help
 
 When any type of mental health concern or behaviour is interfering with a person's life, it is time to get help. Injuring yourself on purpose is a medical concern regardless of how or why it is happening. If you or someone you know is self-harming, it's time to get help from someone. That someone could be a friend you trust, a teacher, your family doctor, a crisis line, or counsellor.
 
 Self-harm is a physical health issue as well as a mental health issue.
 
 To get help for the physical health complications caused by self-harm, one may:
 
 * Find themselves in need of stitches, antibiotics (to fight infection) or other medical interventions as a result of hurting themselves.
 
 * Need to see a family doctor if wounds are not healing or seem infected.
 
 * Need to go to Urgent Care if in need of medical attention for non-life-threatening injuries like stitches or suspected infection.
 
 * Need to call 911 or go to the Emergency Room if an injury has gotten serious or is life threatening (like bleeding too much, losing consciousness, etc.) .
 
 Self-harm is a coping strategy for many people when they are trying to deal with overwhelming emotions, numbness, stressful situations or personal issues. Self-harm isn't a mental illness itself, but it is a sign that someone might need some help coping with a situation or an underlying mental health issue.
 
 Self-harm can lead to other health complications, scarring and feelings of shame or regret. For this reason, help might start with a family doctor, mental health professional, a friend or a trusted adult.
 
 If it is a friend you are concerned about, they may resist help or not even recognize that they need it. They might need you to make the first step. Talk to them, listen without judgement, and encourage them to seek help from a doctor. If you are not sure what to do, you might want to tell an adult you trust that you are worried about your friend. Remember that you cannot ""force"" someone to get help if they're not ready, but you can suggest and try to help connect them to resources.
 
 If you feel like you or a friend is in medical danger, call a crisis line or 911.
 
 Visit our Help Section to find out how to get help for yourself or a friend.
 
 Treatment
 
 Self-harm is not a mental illness, but it is a mental health concern as it usually happens because someone is struggling and needs a way to cope. Like other mental health issues, self-harm and how it is experienced will differ from person to person. Because each case is unique, the treatment will likely be unique for each individual.
 
 Self-harm is a physical health issue as well as a mental health issue. To deal with the physical injury, people who self-harm may find themselves in need of stitches, antibiotics (to fight infection) or other medical interventions as a result of hurting themselves. This treatment might be done by a family doctor, a clinic, urgent care or in the emergency department.
 
 Because self-injury can be dangerous and have long-term effects (scars, accidental long-term injury, infection, etc.) the ideal way to help might be to figure out why a person is self-harming and to help them learn healthier coping strategies.
 
 Self-harm can be connected to mental illnesses like mood, anxiety or eating disorders. To deal with the emotional/mental issue that may be causing the self-harming behaviour, treatment strategies might include any or all of the following: group or individual therapy, life coaching/learning stress management, inpatient treatment, medication, counselling, mindfulness, etc.
 
 Family members of someone who is self-harming and/or has been diagnosed with a mental illness may benefit from therapy, support groups, learning about the issue and discovering ways to support their loved one at home.
 
 Every story is different, and sometimes people need to try different types of supports before they find the right plan for them.
 
 A person who is self-harming, like any other person, will benefit from maintaining wellness and having good supports in their life. 
 
 Myths
 
 Self-harm can be very alarming and scary to those doing it and to the people who care about them. There are discussions and communities online regarding self-harm, and these may be useful and helpful for some, while for others they may be triggering, unhealthy or unhelpful. Having good information about self-harm can be the key to understanding and dealing with it. Some common myths about Self-Harm are:
 
 Myth: People who self-harm are just doing it for attention.
 
 Fact: This is not true for many people, as those who self-harm may actually be pretty secretive about it and go to great lengths to hide their behaviour from friends and family, sometimes for months or years. Some people who self-harm may be doing it and allowing people to see their injuries to draw attention to the fact that they are suffering or feeling overwhelmed. If a friend of yours is self-harming ""just for attention"" that is a pretty drastic thing to do and may be a sign that they want/need help. Wanting or needing attention when you're not well isn't a bad thing.
 
 Myth: Self-harm only happens to certain people. My friends would never self-harm.
 
 Fact: Self-harm is a behaviour that anyone can develop. People from all walks of life can develop this behaviour. It is not caused by your gender, the kind of clothes you wear or music you listen to. Regardless of who it is, anyone who self-harms deserves help if they need it.
 
 Myth: Self-harm is always caused by a mental illness.
 
 Fact: Self-harm is a coping strategy that some use to deal with stress, trauma or overwhelming feelings. Sometimes there is a mental illness causing someone to do this, but not always. 
 
 Support
 
 Supporting someone who is struggling through a tough time or experiencing a mental health issue can be challenging. Ways to support a friend who is self-harming:
 
 * Know the signs of self-harm.
 
 * Encourage professional help for your friend when needed (see Help Section).
 
 * Help your friend to avoid triggers or situations that can cause them to feel like self-harming.
 
 * Be a sounding board. Listening without judgement and without trying to ""fix"" their problems can be incredibly helpful.
 
 * Ask your friend how else you can help. It may be as easy as just providing a distraction, asking them to do simple, relaxing things with you (like hanging out, watching a movie, etc.).
 
 * If you are supporting someone who is self-harming, it can be really distressing. Set some boundaries for yourself, and take care. You can't help someone if you're feeling overwhelmed yourself.
 
 * If you don't know what to do, go to a helpful adult, like a parent, guidance counsellor or teacher you trust. They might be able to support you and your friend to find a solution.

243,1,"Suicide
 
 Suicide is a troubling topic that most of us would rather not deal with, but suicide is a reality, and it is more common than we would like to think.
 
 ? More than 3,500 Canadians kill themselves each year.
 
 ? 1 in every 25 Canadians attempts suicide during his or her lifetime.
 
 ? A 1994 United Nations study over a three-year period found Canada's suicide rate for children and youth under 21 to be among the highest in the world.
 
 Many times suicidal actions are a desperate ""cry for help"" and many suicides can be prevented. By paying attention to warning signs and talking about the ""unthinkable,"" you may be able to prevent a death.
 
 Why do people take their own life?
 
 Most people who attempt suicide are ambivalent about taking their own life, but their circumstances might make them feel that life is unbearable or that they ""deserve"" to die. Suicide can seem like the only way to deal with their problems because they have an extreme sense of hopelessness, helplessness and depression. Some of the factors that may lead a person to attempt suicide are:
 
 * feelings of isolation
 
 * having a serious physical illness
 
 * having severe mental illness
 
 * experiencing a major loss (death of a loved one, unemployment or divorce)
 
 * addiction or substance use
 
 * experiencing major changes in life
 
 * prolonged depression with harmful or negative thought patterns
 
 * post-partum depression
 
 * a history of abuse, neglect, or trauma
 
 * being in an abusive relationship
 
 What are the warning signs?
 
 Some people who kill themselves do not give any warning at all. However, many offer clues or statements to those around them. Individuals expressing suicidal intentions should always be taken seriously. Some of the signs to look out for are:
 
 * direct statements about suicide such as ""I want to die,"" or indirect threats such as ""You would be better off without me""
 
 * personality changes or withdrawn behaviour
 
 * hoarding medication
 
 * giving away prized possessions
 
 * lack of interest in future plans
 
 * isolation from friends and colleagues
 
 * depression
 
 * sudden decrease in levels of hygiene
 
 Some signals that indicate imminent danger for a person expressing a desire to suicide are if they are isolated, have attempted suicide in the past, have a plan for how they will kill themselves and have the means to do so (weapons, drugs).
 
 What can you do to help prevent a suicide?
 
 Suicide is a taboo subject, yet talking about it openly is helpful. A person contemplating suicide needs the support of people who listen and care. If you are concerned that someone you know may be suicidal, take action.
 
 * Find a place to talk where the person feels comfortable, they need to know that you respect their need for privacy.
 
 * Encourage the individual to express their feelings freely - the single most important thing you can do is to listen attentively without judgment.
 
 * Ask them whether they have considered suicide - bringing up the subject will not cause them to act upon it.
 
 * When someone tells you they are going to attempt suicide, it can be scary for both you and them. Stay calm, be honest and tell them about your concern for them - they need to know that someone cares.
 
 * Ask them what you or someone else can do to keep them safe and help them through this.
 
 * Talk about the resources that can support them - family, friends, clergy, counselling or psychiatric treatment.
 
 * Let them know that you are there to support them, but also know your limits - you don't have to do it alone. Taking care of yourself while helping a friend?through a hard time is important.
 
 * Download Be Safe to help you make decisions in a crisis.
 
 What can you do if you're feeling suicidal?
 
 It may seem like there is no light at the end of the tunnel, and asking others for help or talking about your feelings can seem like a daunting task. However, if you reach out, you will discover that there is help and that you are not alone. Many people have felt suicidal when facing difficult times and have survived their struggle, and even thrived. If you have these feelings but don't plan to act on them, you should:
 
 * talk to a trusted friend or family member about your feelings.
 
 * call a crisis telephone support line.
 
 * talk to your family physician; they can arrange for counselling and/or prescribe medication to help you feel better.
 
 * get involved in a self-help group and talk to people who have ""been there"".
 
 * understand that you are not in the best shape to make major decisions, so just focus on the here and now.
 
 * check out our Help Section for more tips and advice
 
 If you do plan to act on your feelings, please get help immediately by doing one of the following (for guidance with this, go to our Crisis Page): 
 
 * call 911 or your local Emergency Response Service
 
 * go to the nearest Emergency Hospital

 Remember you are not alone. Reaching out for help and knowing where to go for positive support can keep you and others safe. You may want to contact your family physician, the CMHA Ontario Division toll free at 1-800-875-6213, your spiritual advisor, the local crisis intervention centre or the Mood Disorders Association of Ontario at 416-486-8046.

244,0,"Celebrating Small Wins
 
 Celebrating small wins: these tips will focus on how these little successes should be a big deal.
 
 One of the most important reminders you can give yourself today is that small or little successes are what keep us going on the way to acheiving our bigger picture goals! Accomplishing something every day is a win. Remember to celebrate the simple things daily!
 
 Don't have time to get in a full workout, or even a few exercises? Instead, take 5-10 minutes to give your full body a proper stretch! Take your time, stretch each area slowly, & remember to breathe. It's a great way to ground yourself & do something good for your body.
 
 The power of progress is often forgotten when we're working towards our goals! Celebrating small wins daily can help us remember that, bit by bit, we are working towards getting where we want to be.
 
 If you don't already, keep a journal book on hand to write down what your little wins are every so often. When you're not having a great day, you can go back to your responses and see how much progress you might be making overall!
 
 Take a look in the mirror today and smile :) You've been doing a great job and are doing the best you can. Be proud of how far you've come. Even if this is all you do today, a smile with some gratitude can be a pretty huge win!
 
 Choosing water as your default drink of the day is a great way to celebrate a small win! You're hydrating your body and helping flush toxins to keep yourself healthy!
 
 .It's okay if you don't get everything done on your to-do list! One thing accomplished is a win! Some days we just need to lay low and that's okay!
 
 Simple things we do daily are all part of the bigger picture! Remember that ANY task you accomplish is helping you reach where you want to go. You're doing awesome, keep at it!
 
 On the days you're struggling to find the meaning and purpose to the ""why"" take a few moments to step outside, meditate, journal, or share your feelings with a trusted friend. Small wins are about being honest with ourselves and giving ourselves the care we need. #mymTips
 
 Decorate your planner, calendar or colouring book! Giving your mind a chance to slow down, have fun, and get creative gives us the energy to keep doing the little things along the way! So many small wins in a day! How are you going to celebrate them?! #mymTips
 
 'Eating healthier' can be a daunting task, especially when so many of us are working or studying from home. Rather than trying to adjust every meal, try setting managable goals, like eating one piece of fruit a day or having at least one serving of protein each weekend.
 
 Need a small win today? Get some fresh air! If you can't go for a quick walk or even step outside, crack a window and sit near it. Your body will thank you!
 
 A great way to celebrate small wins is to share them with people who love and support you. Did something you're proud of today? Text a family member, message a peer, or call a friend!
 
 Recognizing small wins isn't just about having a reason to feel good each day - it can also make us more productive and happier at work! Read more in this @HarvardBiz The Power of Small Wins.
 
 Consistently celebrating small wins by rewarding yourself for them can be a way to combat long-term burnout. Rather than working tirelessly toward a goal that's weeks or months away, take time to reward yourself for the things you accomplish on a daily or weekly basis!
 
 Not sure what classifies as a small win? Consider your only goal to be getting out of bed in the morning & going back to sleep at night. Now that, or anything extra that you do in between, is a small win!
 
 Successfully setting a boundary is one of the biggest small wins you can have! Saying 'no' or prioritizing your own needs is difficult, so every time you do it, be sure to pat yourself on the back.
 
 If you want to celebrate small wins but you're not sure how, try making a list of things you enjoy (e.g. a nice cup of tea, an afternoon nap, games, or time for painting or drawing). When you accomplish a small win, turn to this list for options to treat yourself!
 
 We're often harder on ourselves than we are on the people we love. Every time you accomplish something small but think it's 'no big deal,' imagine what you would tell a loved one who did the same thing. Now say that to yourself!
 
 Wondering how to make the small wins work for you? Check out this @TedTalks by Mehrnaz Bassiri (@gritisanoun)
 
 Unsure of how to acknowledge a small win? Repeat a celebratory mantra! Tell yourself ""I am capable,"" ""I can do hard things,"" or ""I can achieve anything!"" These simple messages can help to build your confidence and encourage you to accomplish other small wins.
 
 When celebrating a small win, take time to reflect on these questions: how does it feel to congratulate yourself? What does your body experience when you point out the small win to yourself?
 
 Looking to celebrate small wins in your life but not sure where to start? Try the ""Friday 5"" ritual! Every Friday at 5pm grab a drink or a snack and celebrate your successes of the week. If this time doesn't work for you, pick another time that does!
 
 Did you know that when you actively celebrate your small wins, you're actually practicing self-love? By recognizing your everyday successes, you help to affirm the love you have for yourself.
 
 Acknowledging your small victories not only helps you but those around you. When others see you celebrate your wins, it invites them to celebrate their own too!
 
 When making deadlines for a project or a goal, make sure they're not too rigid. By making them relaxed, you'll be able to experience more small wins.
 
 Recognizing small wins help you keep track of how far you've come. This is especially beneficial when you're trying to create a new habit or make a lifestyle change.
 
 We get small wins almost every day! Make it a point to stop overlooking them and start noticing them.
 
 It may sound too good to be true, but celebrating small wins actually increases your energy over time. That way you can accomplish more and more!
 
 Celebrate the losses too. We grow and learn through our mistakes, and without these losses, we wouldn't be as grateful for the wins.

245,0,"Balancing Screen Time with Self Care
 
 These tips are about cultivating manageable self care activities while living in a virtual world.
 
 Creating a simple morning routine can start your day in a positive way. Making your bed, showering and putting on clean clothes are some helpful things you can do to get your day started on a better note, plus help you feel accomplished and more ready to tackle the day.
 
 The news can feel like 24/7 information overload about COVID-19. Even having it on in the background can be stressful for our brains. Give yourself a few days away from it if you want! If you're still craving news, try sources like Tank's Good News for uplifting content.
 
 Make ""you"" time a priority. Schedule time to do something for no other reason than that it makes you feel good! Watch a funny movie, dance to your favourite songs, go for a walk, have a bath, eat your favourite food, do a relaxation exercise, or something else entirely!
 
 Ever find yourself on more than one screen at a time? Try using one screen only, and giving that your focus. Breathe through feeling like you need to be checking your phone, laptop, etc. It's okay to not be accessible right away!
 
 Our online lives can make it hard to slow our minds when it comes to bedtime. Can't stop thinking about what's going on? Write it down and postpone your worry until the next day so that you can rest your mind.
 
 Your brain can only handle so much information during a day spent mostly online, so make sure to take breaks! Give your eyes a chance to focus on other things, even close them to rest for a while. It's okay to unplug!
 
 Try to get outside every day, even if it's just for a moment. Breathing in the fresh air, taking in the sights around you and slowing your mind are all great ways to diffuse a day full of screentime!
 
 Are you needing to take a break? Make time to do something creative while you rest, like listening to music and drawing lines and shapes based on the rhythms you hear! Use your ears instead of your eyes and give them a break!
 
 Increase bright light exposure during the day; it helps keep your circadian rhythm healthy! Not only will it increase daytime energy, it will improve sleep quality and ease the online stress from the day!
 
 Plan a day to have no screen time! Have you been wanting to read a book? How about taking a hike, heading to a nearby beach, pond, or lake? Maybe exploring your neighbourhood more? Or just spending a day in bed. Figure out what you want to do, and go for it!
 
 The pressure to be on camera for school or work may prevent you from wanting to virtually connect with loved ones. To give your eyes a break from the screens, try scheduling a phone call instead and put them on speaker while doing activities like doodling or walking.
 
 Have a few minutes between Zoom meetings? Try some of these quick self care activities: confidentlife.com.au
 
 When work, school, & fun activities are all online, it can be difficult to separate them! To establish boundaries between work and play, try to implement rituals after each, like lighting a candle once you finish a lecture or getting a snack when you wrap up a workday.
 
 If you're on your screens a lot before bed, your sleep may be affected. Try to limit this time as much as possible in the hour before you sleep. If you can't, having your devices on 'night' mode can make the blue light less harsh. You may find that you sleep better!
 
 Need some self care during the day, but not sure where to start? One day, create a box with items that comfort you (teas, essential oils, nail care items, fidget toys, nice notes, etc). Decorate it with inspiring quotes and photos, and pull out the box when you need it!
 
 Want to know how to get away from your screen AND get something good from it? Cook! Print out or write out a recipe, put your phone away, and have fun in the kitchen. Not only will you have a yummy meal, but you'll be giving your eyes a rest from all the devices!
 
 When days get busy, it can be difficult to make time to get outside. If you can't go for a quick walk or even step outside, crack a window and work near it. A little bit of fresh air is better than no fresh air, and your body will thank you!
 
 Nowadays, we need our screens for work, school, and even fun, so sometimes putting them away isn't an option. Instead, try 'do not disturb' functions or notification blockers to minimize distractions (like news sites & social media alerts) & keep you focused on one thing.
 
 Want a colourful reminder of self care activities you can do throughout the day? Print out our Self Care Tips and keep it handy for when you have time for a screen break.
 
 Are there books in your home that you never got around to reading? These can be a great break from all the screen time we're used to. Gather the books you haven't paid much attention to and put them in one spot. This spring, see how much of the pile you can get through!
 
 Do you find yourself on screens when you're feeling bored or anxious? It might be time to firmly distinguish between screen time that is helpful and screen time that is harmful. Take a deep look at your screen time and be honest with yourself, is it helping or not?
 
 Make it a habit to have at least one meal per day without screens. Use this screen-free time to be fully present while eating. How does your food taste? What does it make you feel?
 
 To help draw distinctions between school/work and play, use different devices for different activities (e.g. your laptop for school work and your phone for talking with friends or playing games). Then make sure to put away the other device when you're on the other!
 
 Get out a piece of paper and a pen and write things down instead of typing them. Try it out with a to-do list first and then see where your creativity can take you!
 
 Establish a few screen-free zones in your home! For instance, make your bathroom and your bed tech-free areas. It might be tricky at first, but try to hold yourself accountable for making these spaces device-free.
 
 Keep devices out of your reach and things like books, puzzles, and games within your reach. You'll be less likely to use a device if it's in a drawer or a separate room.
 
 Feeling bored? Don't mask your boredom with screens. Instead, let yourself feel and experience it! Boredom can actually be a good thing as it encourages imagination and creativity.
 
 Try to incorporate physical activity into your screen time. Can you do a sitting workout while you're watching Netflix? How about taking the time to stretch while listening to a webinar or training?
 
 Perform posture checks throughout your day. Readjust your sitting position in front of your computer or stand while you work.
 
 Our devices have become our main source of stimulation throughout the day. Switch things up by stimulating your senses in other ways. Light a candle, use a fidget toy, or dance to some music.
 
 Be kind to yourself. It's a stressful time so if your screen time is up, try to cut yourself some slack. Finding balance takes time so be patient with yourself as you do your best. And remember, progress does not equal perfection.

246,0,"Being Present in the Pursuit of Tomorrow
 
 This time of year tends to be very goal-oriented, and while it's important to have goals it's also okay to not get too caught up in the future and to be mindful of the present. These tips are about balancing the here and now with your goals for tomorrow.
 
 Happy New Year! This day can hold a lot of pressure with resolutions and big changes. Stay present in today and enjoy the simple moments in this day. Your goals aren't going anywhere! It's just as important to not focus on our goals as it is to work toward them.
 
 What are three things you can do today that will help towards your goals? Once you figure that out, do them one at a time! When you're done, shift back into living in today. You will feel better enjoying the present moment when you know you were productive as well.
 
 It's normal for things in life to move slowly at times. Last year was so unusual and we are still navigating a pandemic. Make daily reminders to reassure yourself that you're on track, even if you feel like you're not. As the saying goes, Rome wasn't built in a day.
 
 Take some time to journal about a few of your short term goals. How can you work at being flexible when making plans to achieve them? Make sure to include daily rest and self care in these plans.
 
 Creating space each day to have quiet time with yourself is a great way to feel more capable of taking on the future. Reminding ourselves that, at this moment, we are here in the now helps us take space from the pressures of the past and future.
 
 When your thoughts get overwhelmed by the future or past, catch yourself! Stop what you're doing and recentre. What are 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can touch, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste? Remember, you're in THIS moment.
 
 Play Make a Wish. Put your dreams out into the universe and get back inspirational quotes to keep you focused and positive! Then do two things today, however small, that will help you work towards those dreams or goals!
 
 Sometimes our goals can feel far away or even unattainable. Remember that it takes time to build the kind of life you want. Congratulate yourself on being where you are at today! You're doing enough
 
 Rest is one of the most important ingredients in acheiving your goals. Take some time to truly relax and let yourself feel peace for a few moments. Your body, mind, and soul will thank you for it.
 
 Take a look at S.M.A.R.T goals! They are a great model to create goals that you can work toward and achieve. Make self care S.M.A.R.T goals as well. We need to balance work and rest, and planning both can be super helpful.
 
 Have you tried journey mapping? It's a way to create a visual representation of the process of reaching your goals. There are many templates online, or you can do it in your own creative way! After, reward yourself with something that can bring you back to the present.
 
 When you find yourself ruminating on the past or worrying about the future, repeat an affirmation to yourself related to the resilience that brought you here. That resilience has gotten you through many obstacles, and it will get you through many more. You are resilient!
 
 How often do you go for a mindful walk? A walk where your phone is on silent/out of sight and where you truly notice and observe your surroundings, instead of being wrapped up in all of your thoughts? Make it a goal to try this at least once a week if you can.
 
 It can be easy to compare ourselves to others, especially when they seem to be successfully accomplishing goals while you feel stuck. Know that everyone's journey is different and cannot be compared. You are doing the best you can with what you have, and that is enough.
 
 When you're actively working towards your goals, try to just focus on one thing at a time. Multitasking often takes up more time and results in more errors. There's a reason mindfulness is important, and we can't be mindful when multitasking.
 
 Try to make lists with short-term goals for the week so you can have smaller tasks to check off and feel accomplished. It'll also help you stay present and focussed on the things you can do each day, rather than getting too preoccuppied with what you want in 5 years.
 
 Celebrate your small successes! Afterall, the bigger successes are usually a result of many small ones, so make sure to show yourself appreciation for the steps along the way.
 
 Make time to check in with yourself. Are you getting so caught up in your goals and what you DO, rather than remembering what or who you love and who you ARE? Reflect on this and see what changes you might need to make to recentre.
 
 Keep a working list of the things you HAVE accomplished. Look back on it when you're struggling to find motivation for your current goals. You've done hard things before, you can do them again - no matter how small they may seem to others or yourself!
 
 When setting short-term goals, consider what your body needs in the present to thrive in the future. Feeling isolated? Try reaching out to a friend. Feeling lethargic? Get rest and call it an early night. It's easier to meet long-term goals when current needs are met!
 
 2020 taught us that we never know what tomorrow will bring. This can be scary, but it means if we aren't presently fulflled, it might be time to make changes. It's great to work toward goals for your future, but you shouldn't have to sacrifice current happiness for them.
 
 Navigating expectations behind a goal can explain why you set it in the past. What made you want to do this? Were there external influences like friends or family? How will your life change when you achieve this? Now, reflect on these to refine your goal going forward.
 
 Are you struggling to figure out what your passions are? Try one of these activities to help discover them: https://www.personalgrowthchannel.com/2017/08/how-to-find-your-passion-with-5.html
 
 A popular saying is 'you become like the 5 people you spend the most time with.' As you work toward your goals, it's important to have people who love you, encourage you and tell you the truth when you need it most - and they should have traits that you'd like to mirror!
 
 Accomplishing year-long resolutions can be daunting. Instead, break them up by setting daily or weekly intentions. Want to 'be more active'? Be mindful of this by doing a quick stretch twice a week. Then, build up to other exercise, rather than avoiding it altogether.
 
 Attempting to realize our professional aspirations can be a very tricky form of goal-setting. Try answering some of these questions to help you navigate your 2021 career goals: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/23/7-simple-questions-to-help-form-your-2021-career-goals.html
 
 We have different priorities every day. Sometimes school is at the top of the list, and other times it's health, work, family, or friendships and relationships. It's normal to have to change these regularly, and doesn't mean we're neglecting our broader goals when we do.
 
 To make tough decisions that align with your goals, try 'working backwards' in your head. When you come to a crossroads, think about who you want to become down the road, or what you want to end up doing. Then, try seeing which choice best fits with future you.
 
 Having trouble figuring out what motivates you, how you work best, or what your strengths are? Take some of these free personality tests, as they might help you discover things you didn't know about yourself: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personality-tests
 
 It might seem like your accomplishments are everything, but more than tangible things you did, people will always remember how you made them feel. If you feel overwhelmed by resolutions and goals, just remember: simply being kind can have the greatest impact on others.
 
 Remember that you don't HAVE to achieve any of your goals. Life might get in the way, you may change your mind about them, or it may become harmful for you to push yourself to work for them. All of these things are okay. You are worthy no matter what!

247,0,"Gratitude During COVID-19 Holidays
 
 There's a lot to be scared or down about this holiday season. There's a lot we can be grateful for too! Allow yourself to feel both - our sadness is still valid when we practice gratitude and our gratitude is still valid when we're sad. These tips are about gratitude.
 
 Try keeping a gratitude journal. Each day, take a minute to write 2-3 things you are grateful for. Try not to repeat things for as long as you can! It will become easier the more you do it.
 
 Bored and needing some positivity? Play the gratitude alphabet game! For each letter of the alphabet, think of something you are grateful for that starts with that letter.
 
 Try not to compare yourself to others. Instead, recognize that everyone is unique in their own way and take time to think about some of the great qualities that YOU have to offer!
 
 Focus on the little things that you can be grateful for. Are you wearing a warm sweater? Did you eat today? Can you see the sky? Think about what matters to you!
 
 Try incorporating meditation or mindfulness practices into your days. When you slow down, it gives you the opportunity to notice and appreciate the little things.
 
 Pick a day to tell someone that you love what you like or appreciate about them. This can be done by text or call, or even by writing and mailing a postcard or letter! See if you can pick a different person each week to do this for.
 
 Observe your speech patterns or ask other people what words you use often. Are they words like fail, suck, stupid, etc.? Try to catch yourself and see if there are ways you can adjust your sentences if you find you're focussing more on the negatives.
 
 Buy a pack of blank cards from the dollar store and make a point to write thank-you cards. You don't have to wait until you get a gift, saying thank you for small gestures is also meaningful! Imagine what a nice surprise it would be to get a random thank-you card.
 
 If you notice that someone in your bubble tends to talk really negatively, that can rub off on you! Try having a conversation with them about it or consider distancing yourself from them so you can get back to making more room for gratitude.
 
 Look into the ways that you can volunteer in your community at this time. It can help build your self-esteem by doing something good and can even help you appreciate the positive aspects of your life.
 
 The holidays can be difficult when it comes to body image. To combat this, think about appreciating a body part for its function instead of seeing it negatively. E.g. replace ""I hate my tummy"" with ""I am thankful for my stomach because it nourishes me & keeps me going.""
 
 Start the day with gratitude affirmations. Plan to list what you are grateful for every day by saying that list out loud in the mirror, jotting it down, or telling somebody you love. It doesn't have to be time-consuming or exhaustive. Even 1-3 affirmations is great!
 
 Collect images of things you're grateful for and make a gratitude collage. Once it's done, put it somewhere you'll see it every day.
 
 Reflect on how far you've come. What would your past self be grateful for if they saw you now?
 
 When you make a to-do list, supplement it with a blessings list. For each task, include something related that you are grateful for. This helps you make progress while appreciating your current blessings.
 
 When you feel like your life is lacking, make a point to give or share with someone else. This will help you recognize how much you actually do have.
 
 Unplug and get outside by taking a gratitude walk! Bundle up and take time to notice your surroundings and what you feel grateful for.
 
 Thank people who never get thanked like the bus driver, custodian or crossing guard. Check out our interview with Beyond the Wards Canada to see how they've been thanking under-recognized workers during the pandemic.
 
 Instead of a gratitude journal, try a gratitude jar. Cut strips of paper and, each day, write one reason you are grateful and plop it in the jar. When you're feeling low, review the jar entries.
 
 If you are having a hard time with gratitude, try this alternative instead: https://esmewang.com/a-simple-list-that-can-change-how-you-think-about-your-day-no-its-not-a-gratitude-list-2.
 
 Let yourself feel! Appreciate your ability to have emotions, and recognize that feeling things like sadness and anger are okay. Even if you feel like you'll never be happy, don't give up.
 
 Create an enjoyable routine. Make time for practicing gratitude on a regular basis. Pair it with something you like, like a nice cup of tea. Soon gratitude will be a habit!
 
 Try to find the silver-lining, no matter how small it might be. For example, maybe you don't like taking the bus, but are thankful it gives you time to read. Finding silver-linings takes practice, so be patient with yourself.
 
 Browse the app store for your phone to check out some of the different gratitude apps and give one a try! There are many, so there just might be one that you find helpful and that gives you another way to bring gratitude into your life.
 
 The world we live in can seem sad and scary. Seek out positive stories from websites like GoodNewsNetwork.org and share them. It will lift your mood and the moods of those around you, and that's certainly something to celebrate with gratitude!

248,0,"Coping with Seasonal Affective Disorder
 
 With leaves falling and daylight hours shrinking, this time of year can feel dreary for anyone. For those with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), it can be even more difficult. These tips will offer insight on SAD, ideas for preparing for it, and coping strategies.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs within the same season each year (usually during fall and winter) and improves or stops altogether during the rest of the year. Learn more in Illness section - SAD.
 
 An estimated 2-3% of Canadians suffer with SAD. If you have episodes of depression that reoccur during the same season each year, for 2 or more years, you might also have SAD (and not just the occasional winter blues).
 
 In the clinical field, SAD has more recently been renamed ""depressive disorder with seasonal patterns"". If you want to know more about this type of depression, check out this video.
 
 If SAD symptoms are new to you, schedule a check-in with your doctor! They can help you figure out if you have SAD, a different mood disorder, or something else that's causing your symptoms. Together, you can also come up with a treatment plan that feels right for you.
 
 Try aromatherapy! Essential oils can influence the area of the brain (limbic system) that's responsible for controlling moods and the body's internal clock. Try bergamot and lavender oils to help with symptoms of depression!
 
 If you're prone to SAD, make a plan before your symptoms worsen. Create a manageable routine, which includes time for connecting with loved ones, self-care, and activities like exercise and rest. Having a schedule can make you feel more in control as the season changes. 
 
 If the sun is shining, take the opportunity to soak in the vitamin D! Natural light can be a good way to help combat SAD. And, if you feel like you're still lacking vitamin D, you can also talk to your doctor about taking vitamin D supplements in the wintertime.
 
 Sticking to a routine and trying to maintain regular sleep patterns will help you get some light in! Keeping a schedule will expose you to natural light at consistent and predictable times, which your body will come to appreciate.
 
 After talking to your doctor, you may come to the decision together that medication is needed to help stabilize your mental health throughout the winter. This is okay! It may be temporary and, even if it's not, you matter and always deserve relief from these feelings.
 
 Have you tried several seasonal affective disorder therapies, but still feel that something seems to be missing? Explore light therapy! There are many devices available, such as special light bulbs and light boxes, that can help fight the symptoms of SAD.
 
 Try combatting dreary days and dark nights by brightening up your space! Open your blinds to get natural light in when possible, and decorate your surroundings with bright-coloured and airy decor. You can also try adding some plants or greenery to your home.
 
 If you do take medication or supplements, make sure to keep up with your doses. Even this may feel like a tough daily task in the wintertime, but staying consistent with your meds will help you to feel more regulated and equipped to cope when times are tough.
 
 Keep a journal! Release those negative thoughts by writing them down and getting them out of your brain. Just put your pen to paper (or use an electronic device), and try to let out whatever comes to mind.
 
 Eat the rainbow! Different colours of fruits and vegetables contain certain compounds, vitamins and minerals that each have their own health benefits. Getting a variety will ensure you're getting the most health benefits for your brain and overall wellness.
 
 Want to explore some non-traditional treatments? How about Reiki! Reiki is a Japanese treatment that promotes energy healing through either a hands-on or hands-off approach. Find a practitioner in your area and speak with them to learn more.
 
 While meditation is typically thought of as a calming tool, there are also energizing meditations to help you start your day with a positive boost! Try apps like Insight Timer for free guided meditations to stir up some positive energy when mornings are challenging.
 
 Another way to try and give yourself a boost in the morning is to work in some movement. For some, that could be a walk, a home workout, or maybe yoga. For others, it could be doing some stretches or dancing it out to some music. Start small and notice what feels good!
 
 Some days you may not be able to leave your bed and that's okay. Other days, try to do the opposite of what your illness wants. If it's telling you to stay inside and isolate, go out and visit a friend. This is known as opposite action and is a common skill taught in therapy.
 
 As the winter months start rolling in, prepare for what's to come. Make a list of your coping strategies and supports, and try not to wait to access them only when you're severely struggling - practice makes progress, especially when it comes to coping skills.
 
 Since we can't vacation somewhere warm and sunny, practice guided imagery. Close your eyes and imagine walking on a beach. What would it feel like to have the sun shining on your face and to feel the sand in your toes? Look up some guided imagery meditations and give it a try.
 
 Go outside your comfort zone and try some different winter activities. There are many fun things to do that you might enjoy (e.g. renting skates at an ice rink, tobogganing, holiday crafts, making chili, and more). These small acts might be able to bring moments of joy.
 
 Try out photography - it may help you to see things, especially the winter months, from a different point of view. If taking your own photos doesn't end up being your thing, you can take time to appreciate other people's winter photography instead.
 
 Not one for the usual traditions leading up to the holidays? Who says you can't start your own! Creating traditions with family or friends may help you to make meaning during these difficult times.
 
 Educate yourself on the disorder. Read books, watch videos and research about SAD (as long as they are accurate sources of information)! By having a better understanding of something, it can make it easier to talk about what is going on and to make changes in your life.
 
 Some people with SAD have found it helpful to use a dawn simulator. It's like an alarm clock, but without the obnoxious noise! It produces light that gradually increases in intensity, just like the sun, and makes for a more gentle experience of waking up for the day.
 
 Talk it out, whether one-on-one with a counsellor, in other safe spaces like online communities, or with people you know in person! Having an outlet to share what you've been thinking and feeling can help you process things and can be a great relief.
 
 Take some time to think about the winter activities that brought you joy as a kid. What if you scheduled some of them into your next few weeks? Partaking in things that brought us positivity as a kid can be great for our inner child and overall spirit!
 
 SAD may bring about feelings of hopelessness. Make sure you develop a plan to help you through times when that feeling is overwhelming. Download the Be Safe app for help creating a safety plan and see if you can work on it with a supportive person. 
 
 It's important to remind yourself that brighter days are to come. Before you know it, spring will be here. In the meantime, there will be opportunities for light and joy in these months ahead - hold on to those.

249,1,"Fall 2020 Tips
 
 With fall feeling a little different this year due to everything that is happening in 2020, this set of tips will offer autumn inspiration to help you still find comfort in this season.
 
 The change of season is a great time to sit down and look at your daily and weekly routine. Does it feel balanced? Could you make room for more pleasurable activities? Sometimes scheduling it in is the best way to ensure we're making time for pleasure in our lives.
 
 While it's still nice out, prioritize getting some outdoor movement into your day - bonus if you can do so in some 'green space'! The movement, fresh air, and green space can truly make an impact on mood and energy, which may become a struggle as we move into fall.
 
 Try 'eating with the season' (e.g. apples, carrots, kale, sweet potato, and many more) for more nutrients and better flavour. Balancing your intake with whole foods is especially important this time of year if you want to be proactive for the fall and winter months.
 
 Make a list of the things you like about autumn. Find ways to include more of those things in your life, even if that means sticking the list somewhere you'll see it each day. It's okay to miss summer, but try to focus on what you can do in the present.
 
 If you can, invest in some new varieties of tea, coffee or hot chocolate. Set your mug out on the counter before you go to sleep so that it's ready for you to fill up in the morning, as an incentive to get out of bed.
 
 Fall is sometimes referred to as the season of letting go. Let this be your permission to let go of some of what is weighing you down. Let go of relationships that put your needs last, let go of your rigid expectations of yourself, let go of what isn't yours to carry.
 
 Do you have some partway finished projects you've been putting off? Find inspiration in this new season by approaching one of your projects as if it is a brand new task. Breathe new life into an old project with renewed purpose and intention.
 
 Remember that moderation is key. Sometimes the change of seasons inspires us to take on a lot of new commitments or interests, but know when to say ""no"" to other people and things so that you can say ""yes"" to yourself.
 
 Think about how you might be able to surround yourself with warm colours (oranges, reds and yellows) to help balance the cooling climate outside. Could you make some of your own decorations? Find some in a ""buy nothing"" Facebook group? Thrift some new clothes?
 
 Take advantage of this weather and enjoy some activities that were too hot or tiring to do in the summer, e.g. geocaching, rollerblading, landscaping, the list is endless!
 
 Fall is a great time to enjoy some seasonal aromas. Try out scents like pine, vanilla, apple cider, cinnamon and pumpkin spice. Candles, diffusers, incense, and other scented items like soaps can introduce some autumn warmth to your life!
 
 Thanksgiving has a complicated history, and is rooted in settler-colonialism and oppression of Indigenous people. We can't forget its origins, even if we celebrate Thanksgiving in a different way. Read more at  McLeans.ca.
 
 Want to fall clean, but not sure where to start? Check out this helpful cleaning checklist for possible tidying tasks, sorted by room.
 
 Want to elevate your next reading experience? Head outside with snuggly clothes, a warm drink, and a cushion or blanket. Plop down wherever you're comfortable, and let yourself work through your current read as long as you'd like!
 
 Exposure to as much sunlight as possible can be super helpful for your mood, energy, and sleep this season. If you aren't able to get outside or sit near a window during the day, you may want to look into light therapy lamps that can help mimic that sunlight for you.
 
 Snuggling up for a movie is a great way to practice self care. Add some fall vibes to your cozy night-in by finding an October classic, like a Halloween movie or a film that features changing leaves, warm colours, and good vibes.
 
 Hot water can do wonders for your body and your mood. If you've had an off day, or just want to relax, take a hot bath or shower to rejuvenate from the chill outside. It's almost guaranteed to make you feel better!
 
 Goal-setting in the fall can be a little bit trickier than usual. To increase your motivation for the rest of the year, try creating a vision board. It can be virtual or physical, and even have a fall theme for colours and fonts, if you'd like!
 
 Take time to do a bit of a needs assessment with yourself. What needs aren't being met that you could work on? Do you need more quiet time, time to learn, a kinder internal voice, or more physical activity? Come up with some ways that you can start meeting these needs.
 
 More time inside because of COVID-19, plus the colder weather, probably means that you're staring at a screen a lot. Try to be mindful of your posture as you read, type, or scoll throughout the day. The last thing you need are extra aches and pains!
 
 This fall, try going on daily or weekly walks. Each time you wander outside, notice the colours of the leaves and how they've changed since your last walk. Noticing small changes in nature is a way to practice mindfulness, even if just for a few moments of your day.

251,1,"Coping with Transition During a Pandemic
 
 Transition has been a common theme for everybody these past few months, and as we approach fall we're continuing to experience new transitions. This set of tips will be all about coping with transition during these unprecedented times.
 
 During times of transition, creating a schedule to try and give yourself some predictability and structure can be really helpful. Remember to schedule in time for self-care activities and down time too!
 
 Part of the difficulty with change is all the uncertainty. Take some time to write down the worries you have about this change. Then ask yourself how likely those worries are to come true. If they do come true, what can you put in place to help you cope with that?
 
 As cliche as it might be, sometimes it's important to remind ourselves to take things one day, one hour, or one moment at a time. Transition can be difficult for anybody, let alone during unprecedented times like these. It's okay to slow down.
 
 Is there research you can be doing to help you prepare for this transition? It doesn't have to be formal research - it can be as simple as asking people with relevant experience or knowledge for their advice or, if relevant, doing a virtual tour!
 
 Can you get involved in the community that's related to the transition you're experiencing? Look into virtual social groups through your new school, job, or community, so that you can connect with others who are also navigating this change.
 
 When your transition 'to-do' list feels overwhelming, try writing a 'done' list to highlight the things you've already achieved despite your stress and worries. An example could be something as simple as ""got dressed today despite wanting to stay in bed in my pyjamas"".
 
 Create a list of affirmations or mantras you can say to yourself each day to be reminded of your strength and resilience. E.g. ""Even if x doesn't go as planned, I will still be okay"" or ""I have survived difficult changes before and I will survive this.""
 
 There is no change too big or small to seek help for. Reach out to your supports or look into available professional support that you can get connected to during these difficult times. It's amazing what some validation and an alternative perspective can offer.
 
 Are you discovering some strategies that have helped make this time a little easier? Write them down somewhere you'll remember to look so that you can refer back to them during upcoming times of stress. Future you will thank you for it!
 
 With change and transition, there often comes grieving. During the pandemic we've all experienced grief for what life was like pre-covid. Take some time to let yourself grieve, and then also reflect on what some of the positives might be with this change.
 
 Could you make a transition plan to help you cope during these times? What could that look like? A bedtime and morning routine? Making time to reflect each day? Integrating a new or old hobby? Reaching out when you feel ____? Take time and be gentle with yourself as you test it out.
 
 With school starting later than usual, it's understandable to feel more anxious. Get engaged online and connect with other students to see what they're doing to help prepare. Perhaps you won't find all the answers, BUT you could make a new friend along the way!
 
 The people you spend time with can really impact you and your ability to cope through change. Reflect on whether the people you surround yourself with are ones who support your plans and self-growth. It's okay to outgrow people and find new connections that inspire you.
 
 Practicing your routine in your mind, sharing your plans with your friends, and writing it out are great ways to feel prepared to create a balance in responsibilities. Remember to take a break to enjoy your life as well!
 
 Make a pros and cons list regarding the transitions you are struggling with. Review the cons and create some ideas to support yourself through them. Focus on the pros as you navigate these transitions and remember to honour yourself first!
 
 It's hard for anyone to cope with change and transition when our sleep routines are off. Take a look at these tips for healthy sleep habits and see where you might be able to make improvements in yours. 
 
 When you're feeling caught up in the day-to-day stress, remind yourself of the bigger picture. Going through this transition is a step closer to your goals or dreams. Write out some of those goals and dreams to keep you motivated and inspired during the tougher times.
 
 Where can you re-evaluate your schedule and make 'edits' to create a smoother day? Look at how you're balancing your responsibilities and ask yourself what needs some change. What is going well? What isn't? Then, readjust as you need to and keep going! You've got this!
 
 Have you taken time for you lately? Today is a great day to make sure you get in some self care. You are too important and need to take care of yourself first in this transition! What can you do today for YOU? Schedule it in and make it happen!
 
 Celebrate your successes this month. Even small accomplishments deserve a metaphorical high five! Figuring life out is hard and sometimes it can feel like almost everything is wrong. Include focusing daily on what is going right too (even if it feels uncomfortable to do so).
 
 Sometimes it helps to remember change is inevitable and we can build our resilience to face it. Check out this New York Times article on ""How to Stay Optimistic When Everything Seems Wrong"" for some tips on practicing resilience during times of change. 
 
 Change doesn't always have to take the form of a big life event like getting a job, moving, or going back to school. You can find transition in your friendships, relationships, and the way you see yourself. Recognizing these shifts can help you become more self aware.
 
 Having a 'navigator' mindset rather than a 'victim' or 'survivor' one can help you become happier and healthier in times of transition. To learn more, check out this article by Crisis Response Network.
 
 Loss of control is a feeling often associated with change. One way to cope with this is by doing what you can to influence the outcome of a transition in some way. Can you add anything to it? Make a plan for when it's over? Do something for yourself as it's happening?
 
 To help understand yourself during times of transition, you can learn about the 'five Rs' associated with the changes you may be going through: routines, reactions, roles, relationships and reflections. Read more on this from the Resilience Development Company.
 
 Remember that saying, 'when one door closes, another opens'? It's true! If something in your life is coming to an end, there's a good chance that a new opportunity also awaits you. You never know what is to come, and that can be a wonderful thing!
 
 When it feels like everything around you is changing, recognizing stable aspects of your life can provide comfort and make you feel more grounded. As you approach or experience transitions, try making a list of all of the things that will remain in your life post-change.
 
 Change can be difficult, but it can also better us. What changes are you experiencing now? Will they have any positive effects on you, your relationships, or your life? Recognizing upsides to what feels like a tough change can make us feel more ready to take it on.
 
 Sometimes, talking things over or venting to someone you trust can be the healthiest way to get your feelings out. During times of transition, try to schedule time with those close to you, and ask them if they're open to talking about what's going on in your life.
 
 Mental health strategies we use in the fall can often be very different from the ones we find useful in the summer. Set aside some time to look for tools that can help you cope with this transition in seasons.

252,0,"Allyship
 
 With the idea that allyship is a verb (something that you do, on an ongoing basis) rather than a noun (a role to check off or a one-time destination you can arrive at), these tips are about continuously learning and growing as you support others in their fights against injustice and oppression.
 
 Being an ally to any community starts with listening. When having a conversation, practice listening to understand rather than listening to respond with your own point of view.
 
 Marginalized people have provided us with countless resources and information (via articles, books, podcasts, videos, infographics, etc.) to learn from. Make sure you do the research yourself first instead of putting your questions and labour on them.
 
 People need different things from their allies - what's helpful for one person won't always be helpful for all. If you want to ""show up"" for someone, offer a couple ideas of ways you can support, and also leave space to ask what they would find helpful from you.
 
 As always, you can't pour from an empty cup. Be sure to take care of yourself and your mental, physical, and spiritual well-being so that you can support others without burning out.
 
 Allyship is a journey and sometimes we may not get it quite right. Know that messing up is part of the process; apologize, listen and learn, regroup, and keep going!
 
 Many toxic messages have been passed on through generations in our families, but it is our responsibility to learn and do better moving forward. Reflect regularly on the values and beliefs you hold that may need to be challenged in order to be a better ally.
 
 Not sure where to start when it comes to educating yourself on allyship? Simran wrote a blog that can help act as a great starting point for Black Lives Matter and beyond, highlighting numerous resources created by Black people. 
 
 Conversations with friends and family are a great way to be an ally. Oppressed communities need those of us with more privilege to share the load by doing the work in our social circles to correct harmful messages and provide accurate and supportive info!
 
 How can you ""tilt towards"" communities that need allyship? If you feel uncomfortable when thinking of a certain oppressed community, take some time to learn about them!  Understanding each others' humanity is a way to tilt towards those who need our help!
 
 It can feel overwhelming to think about the changes it takes to be a better ally - and yet, those who need our allyship experience overwhelm all their lives. Take a pause and remind yourself this is a marathon, not a sprint. One step at a time, you can do this!
 
 Everybody has their own talents and strengths, and things they can contribute as ongoing allies. If you figure out what your strong points are, you can use these to act against systems of oppression in a way that is effective and feels natural to you.
 
 Have you gone out of your comfort zone with types of cuisine? Supporting local restaurants who are owned by people of different ethnicities can be a neat way to appreciate and learn about other cultures. Next time you order takeout, try a restaurant that's BIPOC-owned!
 
 Another way to set yourself up for continued allyship is to ensure that you continually receive information and insight from BIPOC voices. A simple strategy to diversify the information you interact with is to follow new BIPOC people, accounts and organizations on social media.
 
 Allyship doesn't always mean you agree with everything said by a person you're an ally to. It means listening with an open mind, trying to understand their experience, being compassionate regardless of differences and knowing one person doesn't represent an entire group. 
 
 If you're experiencing burnout from practicing allyship, check in with somebody you trust and can talk to. Working through your feelings with somebody else can take the weight off of you and help you problem solve ways to move forward healthily.
 
 Don't let your fear of being wrong guilt you into silence on issues that you care about! Practicing allyship means realizing that in speaking about injustice, saying nothing at all is worse than saying something you may later be corrected on.
 
 When educating yourself on new topics as an ally, try to find anti-racist materials that fit your learning style. For example, if you're an auditory learner, podcasts (by BIPOC) may help you take in new information in a way that is easier for you.
 
 For non-Black people of colour, the first step to allyship might be identifying the racism, shadeism and anti-Blackness that exist even within your own family or community. Read Conny's insight to Black allyship from an Asian perspective.
 
 To practice allyship we must examine our implicit biases (the prejudices we hold that we might not even be consciously aware of) so that we can begin to work on and challenge them. You can start by taking the Implicit Association Tests by Harvard. 
 
 Allyship may require us to ""show up"" if we witness harassment and here is an incredible graphic on how to do so safely. If anyone's safety is at risk, ask someone nearby for support or look into services you can call for emergency help.
 
 If you're of voting age, casting your ballot is another way you can make a difference as an ally. When elections come around, do your research to find candidates committed to the action that you want to see in your community. How do they speak about inequality and equity? 
 
 Much of the food, fashion, and music that we consume today has Black roots or influence. Practicing allyship can mean investing time and effort to learn about how Black people have shaped art and culture as we know it. 
 
 Do some research on non-profit organizations who work with marginalized communities in your area. Even if you don't have extra money to donate, you could volunteer for them, participate in their events, share their info, or sign petitions they might have.
 
 Part of being an ally can be investing your money in people, places, and organizations that you believe in (when you're able to). Have you looked into local BIPOC-owned businesses instead of supporting large chains? You'd be surprised to see how many alternatives are out there!
 
 If you're enrolled in a post secondary institution, there are likely student-run clubs that not only provide community but also work to educate others on various races, ethnicities, and cultures. Seek these out, and look into how you could get involved.
 
 Practicing allyship requires stepping out of your comfort zone. It's okay to feel afraid, confused, or uncomfortable at times, and to need to work out these feelings. Do what you have to in order to keep showing up so that these feelings don't hold you back.
 
 There are endless media resources to learn from and better equip ourselves with as allies! Check out Tasha K's incredible Anti-Racism Resource Guide for tons of recommendations and direction on what to watch, read and listen to. 
 
 Growth and shifting opinions are part of allyship. It's okay to realize we didn't have the right information before or that we were on the wrong side of justice. Never be ashamed of a change of heart when it's for the better!
 
 Part of allyship is learning about the impact of our words so that we can work towards using inclusive and anti-oppressive language. Many common phrases or words have oppressive roots - take some time to learn what they are and work them out of your vocabulary.
 
 There can be even more ""subtle"" forms of racist language called microaggressions. As allies, it can help to make some notes that you can refer to when responding to someone who has said a microaggression. Check out this article to get you started. 
 
 As you continue to practice allyship, know that your efforts matter. It's easy to feel like we're never doing as much as we should... but even if you make a difference in one life, place, class, organization, or community, you are part of a greater, long-term cause.

253,1,"Caring for Your Mental Health
 
 Everyone has mental health and sometimes we need to tend to it a little more. This can be hard to do at times, so here are some tips to get you started.
 
 Mental health awareness is a way that we can reduce the stigma of people being diagnosed and living with mental illness. Learn more about mental illnesses and the impact on people's lives to help you become a better mental health ally.
 
 Creating a simple morning routine can start your day in a positive way. Making your bed, showering and putting on clean clothes are some helpful things you can do to get your day started on a better note, plus help you feel accomplished and more ready to tackle the day.
 
 There's a lot of info about mental illness and mental health, but it's important to make sure you're getting it from a reliable source. A lot of info can be biased and stigmatizing - be an ally by sharing only accurate and compassionate sources like @CMHA_NTL @MHCC_ @CAMHnews
 
 Do you feel like your health care provider isn't giving you the help you need, or isn't a great fit? Finding the right support can take time, keep advocating for your needs and don't give up. Think of it like dating, you don't quit just because the first few people aren't a fit!
 
 If you work, does your workplace have policies in place about how you can care for your mental health? Inquire about taking a ""mental health day"" like you would a ""sick day"", but for your mind. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health!
 
 Having healthy relationships is sometimes difficult when you are working on yourself. Take one day at a time and keep your communication clear so that your boundaries are clear too. It's okay to take time away from people to focus on YOU!
 
 You don't need to pretend like everything is always okay if it's not. You deserve support, and you won't receive what you need if you don't let people know how you're really feeling.
 
 Do you have too much stuff in your home and find it difficult to keep it clean? It's easy to accumulate things, but if it's adding to your stress you may want to start a to-do list of small things to tackle that will help make your space feel less stressful.
 
 Feeling stuck in anger and frustration can leave you stressed and exhausted. Pause what you're doing to acknowledge your feelings, and then try to break down what the issues are by writing out all the thoughts that are tied to these current emotions.
 
 Have you been diagnosed with a mental illness? You are not alone and there is hope! Many who are diagnosed find ways to manage and even recover. Check out our illness pages to learn about your specific diagnosis, myths, facts and tips on how to manage.
 
 Taking care of our physical health is something that's widely promoted in our daily lives, but do we have enough coonversations about being mentally well? Help start more conversations by using social media to share how YOU take care of your mental health.
 
 Sometimes the people around us impact our mood and mental health. If it's safe to do so, it might be worth having a conversation about how you're feeling - otherwise, they can't change what they aren't aware of. Focus on ""I"" statements and avoid blaming statements.
 
 What coping skills do you default to when you're not feeling ok? Checking in with how you cope and its impact on your overall health gives you a chance to make adjustments. Try to write down a list of healthy coping skills that you can access when you need them.
 
 ""Simple"" things can help you in a moment of panic or frustration, and can provide your nervous system the chance to slow down - which will then help slow down your thoughts! Go for a walk, colour a mandela, draw something, or write it all out and crumple it up!
 
 Mental health can ebb and flow from feeling okay to feeling like life is out of control. It's a learning process to find out what works for you in regards to medication, therapy or self help. Don't put pressure on yourself to rush into feeling ""normal"". It takes time.
 
 Often, those with poor mental health may also have low self esteem. Part of building our self-esteem means working to see our own strengths and positive qualities - we all have them! Try this worksheet, from Therapist Aid, to help you think about yours.
 
 Breathing exercises can be a great mental health tool. Try deep belly breathing: put 1 hand on your belly and 1 on your chest, take a deep breath in your nose and feel your belly push the lower hand out while the hand on your chest stays still. Slowly exhale from your mouth.
 
 Do you struggle to name the emotions that you're experiencing? Create your own feelings wheel! It's a simple, yet creative way to help you identify your different emotions. Choose colours that YOU feel represent each emotion.
 
 So you've tried it all: yoga, mindfulness, journaling, you name it, and you're still struggling. Coping strategies can sometimes only take you so far - maybe it's time to reach out to a crisis line or mental health professional. You aren't always meant to fight this alone!
 
 Avoiding messages and calls from friends/family because you're struggling? It's okay to need space, but try not to isolate either. Start by choosing one trusted person to reach out to and try to let them know what's been going on. Or, try a helpline if that's easier!
 
 Being outside in the fresh air and sunlight can help elevate your mood. If you can, pause what you're doing and get outside for 30 minutes! If you have yard work, that might be a great task to make the time go by and it's double the accomplishment!
 
 Acts of kindness are great for the person on the receiving end, but also give you a positive boost too! Showing someone you care about them can make them feel good and that is awesome in itself. There are a lot of ideas online if you need some inspiration.
 
 Knowledge really can be power. Add to your toolbox by learning more about mental health and how to take care of yours; you could attend a webinar, listen to a TEDtalk or podcast, read a book or memoir, or even talk with someone who is well-versed on the subject!
 
 Taking even 5 minutes a day to write out some of your thoughts and feelings can make a big difference. It's a helpful way to process some of what's going on, lessens the weight on your mind, gives you a safe space to practice expressing yourself, and so much more.
 
 The recovery journey can be ongoing, so it's important to have a good support system along the way. Write out a list of safe and supportive people that you can talk to when times are tough, keep it somewhere you'll see it so that you can be reminded you're never alone.
 
 Create a self care box or basket that you can turn to for comfort and inspiration. Some ideas: worry stones, candles, essential oils, lotion, fidget toys, Play-Doh, tea, gum or mints, tissues, inspiring quotes, and a list of coping strategies or feel-good activities!
 
 Make ""you"" time a priority. Schedule time to do something for no other reason than that it makes you feel good! Watch a funny movie, dance to your favourite songs, go for a walk, have a bath, eat your favourite food, do a relaxation exercise, or something else entirely!
 
 Sometimes saying ""yes"" to ourselves means saying ""no"" to others. If you notice that you've been taking on too much, remind yourself that in order to look after YOU and your needs, it's crucial to assert yourself and not just say yes to every request that comes your way!
 
 Write a thank-you note to let someone know you appreciate them - maybe even write one to your past or present self (to recognize your own resilience, strengths, or even vulnerabilities)! Written expressions of gratitude can be a powerful tool for our mental health.
 
 Taking care of your mental health is one of the best things you can do for your quality of life. It takes time to figure out how to manage the stressors in life and things will be always changing. If you need help, find your local CMHA or call 1-833-456-4566.

254,1,"Celebrating Pride During a Pandemic
 
 June is LGBTQ2S+ #Pride month, and even a pandemic can't stop that! These tips are all about supporting yourself and feeling pride during these atypical times.
 
 In order to feel pride for the communities we belong to, it's important to learn the history behind them. The LGBTQ2S+ community wouldn't be where it is without the #Black trans women who head started the #StonewallRiots 51 years ago, Stonewall Inn - June 28, 1969: Where Pride Festivals Started.
 
 Take a look at the people and activities you surround yourself with and re-evaluate what they bring to your life. You don't need to make space for people or things that don't support and embrace your sexuality or gender identity (or the sexuality and gender identity of others).
 
 Do you feel alone, wrong or ""unnatural"" for your sexuality or gender identity? Nature is actually full of all kinds of sexualities and gender identities - there's nothing unnatural about being LGBTQ2S+. Check out this TEDx talk to learn more.
 
 Unfollow any social media or news outlets that may be toxic or harmful. Instead, follow outlets that celebrate self-expression and the LGBTQ+ community. Examples; @them, @xtramagazine, @pinknews, etc.
 
 Live in Ontario and want to build your circle with some professional supports? RainbowHealthOn has a service provider directory of those who are dedicated to providing inclusive and competent services for members of the LGBTQ2S+ community.
 
 An important part of your #pride is making sure you're getting proper info about your sexual health. @Scarleteen, @PPofTO and Teen Health Souce are great youth resources that allow you to ask questions directly to trained volunteers.
 
 Spend some time researching the history of the LGBTQ2S+ community and pick 3 of your favourite fun or inspiring facts about it to share with your loved ones or on social media.
 
 Write down 1 thing each day that you like about yourself or a strength/positive trait you have. Continue for the rest of the month, then read the list you've compiled at the end. It can be hard to see at times, but there's so much of yourself to be proud about!
 
 It can be draining to feel like you're constantly hiding who you are. Find people and places (online) that encourage and support you in being your genuine self - rainbow and all! Those people and places do exist, and you deserve to experience them.
 
 Being a member of the LGBTQ2S+ community doesn't mean you're immune to having homophobic, biphobic or transphobic beliefs. It's so ingrained in our society that sometimes we have internalized prejudices. Take some time to reflect and work on any you may have!
 
 Even if you'll be by yourself all day, try expressing yourself through your appearance! Wear what makes you feel comfortable and confident - whether it's a certain colour, style, or supposedly for a particular gender. If you like makeup, play around with that too!
 
 Are you questioning your sexuality or thinking about coming out? Check out one young person's advice based on her experience with navigating her sexuality and coming out last year.
 
 If you're in quarantine with people you haven't come out to, maybe even because they're homophobic or transphobic, @egalecanada has a great infographic for navigating this.
 
 The words that we use or hear can truly have harmful impacts. Play this interactive game, Aerin the Ally, to feel the #Pride that comes with transforming hurtful messages into inclusive and positive ones!
 
 While professional support can play a vital role, sometimes peer support can be what we need too! @LGBTYouthLine is a Canada-wide peer support service for LGBTQ2S+ youth that offers chat, text and email from 4-9:30ET daily, youthline.ca.
 
 Sometimes immersing yourself in a healthy dose of fantasy can be a neat way to engage in self care and escape for a bit. Click through this awesome Queer Trans Mentally Ill Power Fantasy for an empowering example!
 
 Being around people (even virtually) who share similar identities or feelings can help us to feel less alone. Are there any LGBTQ+ youth groups in your community you could join online? If not, think about starting your own!
 
 Create a mantra that highlights the things you love about yourself - if self-love feels too far away, try a mantra that offers self-compassion or empowerment. Repeat it to your reflection each morning or any time you need a pick-me-up throughout the day.
 
 Are you getting your daily dose of laughter? Try seeking out queer inclusive comedy to live out your #pride while having a laugh e.g.; Wanda Sykes, Jes Tom, Dewayne Perkins, Jay Jurden, Hannah Gadsby, or show's like Netflix's Sex Education, Feel Good, and so many more!
 
 When highlighting #BlackLGBTQ role models and perspectives, read a blog on mindyourmind that reflects on how revolutionary it felt when Frank Ocean shared his #comingout letter with the world. Find more inspiration in empowering stories of #Pride like these!
 
 Taking care of our sexual health is so important for overall health, whether you're LGBTQ+ or heterosexual! It's even more important to be safe and responsible right now with #COVID19. @SOGCorg's Sex and U website shared a helpful guide.
 
 Feel proud of your identity and others' on the #LGBTQ2S+ rainbow by practicing gender-inclusive language. Our words can have a powerful impact! @egalecanada provided Inclusive and Affirming Language Tips.
 
 When you're trans or non-binary, it can be tough to feel #pride if you're struggling with #genderdysphoria. Look towards others with similar struggles to see what helps them, like this great blog posted on @RadicalBodyLove's site.
 
 Poetry and creative writing can be a great way to express yourself and your #pride. Some may not appeal to you, but finding poetry that does speak to you can be life-affirming! Maybe even write a few of your thoughts down and create your own poem.
 
 June is normally a big one for #pride festivals, but luckily there will still be lots of virtual festivities taking place, like the world's biggest pride celebration hosted by @GlobalPride2020.
 
 When coming to terms with your sexuality or gender identity, you may feel lost, ashamed, or other difficult emotions, but try not to let yourself sit in them. Look towards others' stories, Derek, to help you process yours and feel less alone in it.
 
 For a database of all kinds of youth LGBTQ2S+ resources and supports (everything from advocacy, to social and health services, to food and housing, and lots in between) from 40+ countries, check out itgetsbetter.org.
 
 Now more than ever it is important to keep finding ways to express and build up your #pride. ""I am slowly replacing the voices in my head, those voices of the bullies and harassers, with voices that celebrate what makes me unique, different and, well, me."" ~ @lavernecox
 
 Even though June ends today, #pride doesn't stop here! Keep pride in your life by including it in the media you consume; watch/listen/read media with authentic and inclusive LGBTQ2S+ perspectives. Here are some of our recommendations, LGBTQ2S+ Media Examples with Inclusive Representation.

255,0,"mindyourmind Favourites
 
 We wanted to change things up again for this set of tips, so four mindyourmind staff each chose some of their favourite tips that we have shared in the past to give you a whole variety!
 
 A walk in a green space can give you a break from ""attention fatigue"". Go outside on your own and leave your phone in your pocket.
 
 Drink water! Staying hydrated is important for your physical and mental health. Even minor dehydration can affect mood and make it more difficult to concentrate.
 
 Coffee can be okay in moderation, but make sure you aren't using it to top up your energy regularly in place of sleep. It can increase blood pressure and anxiety, among other things, and can interfere with our sleep.
 
 Instead of a gratitude journal, try a gratitude jar. Cut strips of paper and, each day, write one reason you are grateful and plop it in the jar. When you're feeling low, review the jar entries.
 
 Sometimes embracing diversity starts from within. Think about the things that have shaped you and your beliefs. Then think about someone you know and the things that might have influenced their life differently than yours.
 
 Breaking free from toxic relationships is one of the most difficult things you might go through. Setting boundaries and saying goodbye - or taking a break - is OK. It might give you time to reflect on how to move forward.
 
 Even though things feel rough right now, it will get better! Shift your focus by looking to the future.
 
 Verbalizing how you feel is not always easy. When you're having trouble communicating your emotions, try drawing or painting what you are experiencing. Play with different colours, shapes and textures to represent the emotion(s) you are feeling.
 
 Useful journal prompt idea: jot down different ways to ask for what you need when you're feeling low. What tends to be helpful when you feel that way? It can be hard to pinpoint these things in the moment, so having it already written out somewhere can really help.
 
 Use a journal to capture what happened during your therapy sessions, track your triggers, or make a list of different coping strategies to try. Take a look at this page for more journalling inspiration on the topic of mental health! 
 
 Some days you may not be able to leave your bed and that's okay. Other days, try to do the opposite of what your illness wants. If it's telling you to stay inside and isolate, go out and visit a friend. This is known as opposite action and is a common skill taught in therapy.
 
 Constant negativity in the news can affect your mental health. Take a news break, or check out sites like Positive.News and Good News Network.
 
 Don't be afraid to ask someone to help YOU get help. It can be exhausting to navigate and advocate for yourself when you're struggling.
 
 Write out what you're feeling when the urge to self harm arises. You might be surprised how it can help relieve some negativity.
 
 Try to get yourself on a consistent sleep schedule. Having a routine will help you structure your day and will increase the likelihood that you'll get enough sleep.
 
 Remember, all you need to do is try your best. Take things one day, hour or minute at a time.
 
 Social media can make you feel worse. Make sure you curate a positive social media feed by following mental health advocates and other positive pages. Make sure to set limits so you don't scroll your whole day away.
 
 Verbalizing how you feel is not always easy. When you're having trouble communicating your emotions, try drawing or painting what you are experiencing. Play with different colours, shapes and textures to represent the emotion(s) you are feeling.
 
 Keep active to boost your mood and your energy! Try an activity like hot yoga or go for a jog outside in nature. It may seem impossible, but the exercise can help wonders.
 
 Know that there is always someone you can talk to, try calling a crisis line. There will be a trained person on the other end who is there to support you, provide you with helpful coping tools and possibly provide helpful referrals.
 
 If you find yourself dwelling on something, give yourself a time limit: ""I will give this worry 10 minutes of my time, and then I'm done."" Distract yourself with something new once the time is up.
 
 Is there someone who encourages and supports you? Take some time to thank them, whether it's a thank you card, surprise picnic or a big hug. Focusing on the positive will take your mind off the negative for a while.
 
 Supporting a friend can mean feeling like you're on call 24/7, which is impossible. Help them identify others they can call for backup.
 
 Scribble it out! Did you know that scribbling can help to reduce anxiety or anger? Practice applying different levels of pressure while you scribble and then reflect on how you feel afterwards.
 
 When in recovery, remember that healing isn't linear and relapse isn't failure.
 
 Can't identify supportive people in your life? Make it homework to seek out helpful people or community groups/agencies.
 
 Surround yourself with people who lift you up. There's no room in your circle for people who aren't proud of you!

256,0,"Self Care During COVID-19
 
 With lots of changes happening around us, it's important to keep in mind the ways that we can take care of ourselves. These times may be tough, but so are we! We can get through this together.
 
 In stressful times, it is important to stay in some form of routine to help you get through the day. Try writing out your daily routine and even create a weekly one to help build on that structure.
 
 Sleep is vital to your overall mental and physical health, so make sure you are getting enough! Having a consistent sleep schedule can be helpful for this. When possible, aim to be in bed around the same time each night and out of bed around the same time each morning.
 
 Do you have a wind-down routine to help you get ready for sleep? Are there ways you can make your bedroom more inviting to you? For instance, trying to go to sleep in a messy room can prevent us from having the ultimate sleep experience.
 
 Do you have a morning routine to start the day on a positive note? Ideas: a yoga or mindfulness exercise, relaxing with a cup of tea/coffee before getting ready, or writing your thoughts and intentions for the day in a journal to help clear your mind and motivate you.
 
 Try not to keep your worries and fears bottled up. Talk about them to people you trust, or reach out to your local mental health helpline. The Mental Health Commission of Canada created a great list of crisis lines and other mental health supports that you can view here.
 
 Social/physical distancing is so important in order to lessen the spread of COVID-19. You may feel fine, but could still be carrying the virus and could spread it to others. Following the recommendations and protocols for your area will help all of this end sooner!
 
 These times can feel lonely, but that doesn't mean you're alone. Try making a list of safe people you can reach out to. It can also help to schedule in social time to keep you from becoming too isolated e.g. schedule a video chat with a friend or loved one and stick to it.
 
 Once you've validated your tough feelings, try challenging them with a new spin, e.g., taking a break from being social in person might help you find creative ways to stay in contact with others. You might even find you're reaching out to friends you don't often speak to!
 
 Anticipate that others around us might be struggling and stressed out with the current situation. Try your best to be patient and supportive - and remember to show yourself love, too! You can get through these tough times together (even when physically apart).
 
 Is someone you're living with being negative or moody and making it difficult to be around? Try some positive self-talk and self-soothing to avoid reacting harshly. Remember to also practice healthy boundaries to give yourself breaks from the negativity.
 
 The news can feel like 24/7 information overload about COVID-19. Even having it on in the background can be stressful for our brains. Give yourself a few days away from it if you want! If you're still craving news, try sources like Tank's Good News for uplifting content.
 
 On the days that you are wanting to stay informed with the news, set limits to how much you watch/read/listen to it. For example, set a 30 minute timer when you're accessing your news media of choice and try to limit yourself to a maximum of two news sessions a day.
 
 If you're feeling overwhelmed by everything going on, try to stop what you're doing and focus on your breathing. Download an app like aware for free guided breathing exercises. Taking this time away from worrying and negative feelings will help you slow down and re-centre.
 
 Is your living space a zen spot to be? Set out a time to clear an area in your home where your mind can be more at ease. Do you have twinkle lights, candles, pillows and a rug to sit on? Some of these things can make a very cozy place for you to relax your mind.
 
 Boredom can happen when you are at home more than you're used to. Make a list of activities you can engage in and even give them time limits so that it will help you commit to the activity. For example, an hour of colouring, a 15 minute mindfulness activity, a 20 minute walk, etc.
 
 Are there books in your home that you never got around to reading? Gather the books and/or magazines that you haven't paid much attention to and put them in one spot - see how many of them you can check off the list in the next little while.
 
 Try to set aside time to do nothing! Yes, we all have lots of things to get done, but we can also carve out time to do nothing and allow ourselves to be okay with that. If it helps, rather than seeing it as ""nothing"", think of it as time to recharge.
 
 If you are tired of staying in your home, maybe it's time to venture outside? Find a new area to explore nearby where you can still keep a safe distance from other people. Breathe deeply while you walk and take in as much as you can of these new surroundings.
 
 Make a list of old shows or movies you once enjoyed. See which ones you can find to rewatch and see if you still like them. Reflect on what it was you liked about each one and see if there are different reasons now. It can be fun to revisit the past through TV and film.
 
 Make or find a playlist with some of your favourite songs that inspire you to move and, as Meredith Grey would say, ""Dance it out!""
 
 Make a group chat with friends to send funny memes or uplifting quotes throughout the day. There are lots of fun group chat ideas - you can compile lists of each other's recommendations for movies, books, tv shows, workouts, etc.
 
 Self care is important in times that you're feeling disconnected or out of sorts, because it helps you relax and focus on doing something kind for yourself. How about making a DIY face mask? They can be for anyone, and there are a ton of different recipes to try online!
 
 If you're wondering what the future will hold and it's feeling overwhelming, take a moment to do a mindfulness exercise. Sometimes the best thing we can do for our minds and bodies is bring ourselves back to the present moment. Here are some basic exercises to try!
 
 It's a great time to sit down and think about the ""to do list"" you've been avoiding. Getting things out of our minds and onto paper can be satisfying on its own! Start by focussing on smaller tasks - if it helps, even give yourself a checkmark for getting out of bed!
 
 If you're looking for some new ways to fill your time that feel stimulating for your brain, there are lots of free online learning opportunities like webinars, tutorials, and courses! Check out websites like Coursera?or edX.
 
 If it's safe to do so, and you're able to keep at least six feet away from others, getting even ten minutes of fresh air each day can make a big impact on our health - mentally and physically! Set an alarm or reminder on your phone to make sure you're not missing out on your daily fresh air.
 
 It can be hard to see the good when times are so tough. Trying to identify even small things we're grateful for each day can have a surprising impact on our mood and outlook. Did you see the sun today? Find a funny meme? Hear a new song you really liked? Write it down!
 
 Grab some boxes and bags and start spring cleaning. Decluttering can be good for your mental (and physical) health and can benefit others if you're able to find a local charity to donate some of your things to. Win-win!
 
 Cooking your food from scratch is a satisfying activity. Find new recipes in the recipe books you have lying around or on pinterest! Ask around what others are doing for meals and make extra for leftovers.
 
 You might be doing okay during this time of social distancing, but are your friends? Take time out of your day to check in with the people you care about to reassure them that they are not alone.

 The new year is a time when many people seek to change and improve. To change things up, this set of tips will focus on four different areas of self-improvement: healthy consumption, budgeting, increasing physical activity and healthy sleep patterns!
 
 Take time to reflect on your spending! Are there ways you could save money? Try making coffee at home vs. buying at the store, or making lunch the night before to avoid buying it out of convenience the next day. 
 
 Is it time to quit smoking or vaping? There are so many amazing reasons to free yourself from these harmful habits! Here are some helpful tips.
 
 It's that time of year to do a social media detox! Delete accounts that make you feel bad or push unrealistic ideals. Try changing your relationship with social media! Check out these tips to help you get started.
 
 How many hours a day do you watch TV? There are so many streaming services and YouTube channels that suck us in for (maybe) too long. Try to track and limit how much you watch. 
 
 Try to be mindful of not engaging in the toxic trend around needing to ""eat clean"", ""detox"", or whatever other nonsense you hear from people suggesting you need to make up for how you ate over the holidays. Being stressed and obsessed with being healthy is actually unhealthy!
 
 Part of a healthy lifestyle involves balance. If something is important to you and makes you happy, you don't have to cut it out of your life completely. If it's not the healthiest, ask yourself if there's a way to do it in moderation or more safely.
 
 If you're not ready to quit drinking or using substances, try planning ahead to ensure that you're safe. You can do this with our Getting High tool!
 
 Take time to enjoy each day, even for a few moments. Dance to your favourite song, chat with a friend, have a relaxing shower, laugh! Doing something enjoyable each day will help you build up to enjoying more and more of your life, even when challenges are happening.
 
 Our mind and body are connected! Taking a walk to clear your head is a great way to process what's on your mind, while getting some exercise into your day.
 
 Consistency is key for getting into the habit of adding exercise to your life. You don't need to start big, just try to make it regular. A ten minute walk each day, or 20 reps of bicep curls can soon become more once you're ready for it.
 
 Reframe the way you think about exercise. Shifting your mindset to see physical activity as something kind to do for your body and that will likely help you feel better, rather than a punishment or chore, will help motivate you to get moving!
 
 Make a plan and carve out time for exercise during your weekly schedule to help you follow through with your intention to be more physically active.
 
 Do you need some outside motivation to get your body moving? Look on Instagram or Pinterest to see what is offered for free from trainers, and follow their tips and tricks to stay motivated.
 
 Do you have a friend or family member you could walk with often? Or does someone have a dog that you could walk? Getting exercise doesn't have to be a solo activity!
 
 Do ""challenges"" motivate you to follow through with something? Pick a plank, squat or crunch challenge to increase the number of reps you do every day over a span of 30 days.
 
 Think about why you are budgeting - what's your long term goal? Figure out where you want to be before you try to get there.
 
 You'll need to gather some info in order to start budgeting: income (after taxes), fixed expenses, variable expenses, occasional expenses, and savings.
 
 Figure out your monthly income as a starting point to guide your monthly budget. If your income varies (e.g. you're self-employed, part-time, etc.), divide your annual income by 12 for a general average of your monthly income.
 
 Fixed monthly expenses are those that tend to stay the same (or close to the same) every month. They include rent, internet, utilities, etc.
 
 Variable expenses change from month to month. They include gas, groceries, daily coffee, meals out and entertainment expenses.
 
 If you run into unexpected expenses, consider selling unwanted items or doing odd-jobs. If this expense seems to happen regularly, start budgeting for it.
 
 Track your spending by keeping your receipts and recording them in an app. This will let you see trends and areas where you could cut back and save.
 
 Unplug an hour before you would like to go to bed so you can mentally wind down. Listen to relaxing music or some guided meditation to help shift into sleep mode.
 
 If you find your mind running a lot at bedtime, consider talking to a helping professional. Having a positive outlet for stress is a great way to begin having better quality sleep.
 
 Be mindful that caffeinated drinks stay in our systems for six to eight hours. Aim to drink decaffeinated options in the late afternoon so that by bedtime the caffeine is out of your system.
 
 Work towards a regular sleep schedule. This means you are going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, which is a great way to get in tune with your circadian rhythm and evolve to a healthier sleep pattern.
 
 Increase bright light exposure during the day; it helps keep your circadian rhythm healthy! Not only will it increase daytime energy, it will improve sleep quality!
 
 Drinking alcohol before bedtime can negatively affect your sleep, even if it seems to help you fall asleep initially. Alcohol is known to cause increased sleep apnea, as well as disruptive and irregular sleep patterns.
 
 If lying awake in bed gives you anxiety or you have been there for more than 30 minutes, get up and try a relaxing activity in a different spot until you feel sleepy again.
 
 Can't drown out all the noise in your bedroom? Try a white noise machine to help give your room a constant sound and prevent drastic changes in volume that could disrupt your sleep. Can't afford a white noise machine? Try a free app!
 
 Some medications can affect your sleep patterns. Talk to your doctor and see if yours may be causing you to have a restless night.

260,0,"Navigating Bullying
 
 Bullying takes on many forms, be it face-to-face or online. These tips share insight, information, and advice for navigating bullying as a victim, a bystander, and even some resources for those who are doing the bullying.
 
 Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behaviour that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behaviour is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time.
 
 Almost all of us have experienced bullying at some point in our lives, but that doesn't always give us the full picture. Read Elora's blog to learn more about the different types of bullying and the effects it can have.
 
 Know that you are not alone. Reach out to someone you trust ((e.g. friend, teacher, counsellor or family member) and tell them you're being bullied. It might be a difficult conversation, but it's an important one to have.
 
 Get 24/7 help at your fingertips with BullyingCanada by calling or texting 877 352-4497.

 ""Don't you ever let a soul in the world tell you that you can't be exactly who you are."" - Lady Gaga
 
 The first Monday of October is World Day of Bullying Prevention. Educate yourself on the signs and effects of bullying, and stand up for those who can't! Your voice matters
 
 Stick with friends! Avoid being alone in places that make you feel unsafe - there is safety in numbers.
 
 Stand up for yourself! Sometimes it is easier said than done, but try to be assertive and confident. Your body language can say a lot, so stand up tall and make eye contact. It can show the bully you're not going to keep putting up with this!
 
 If standing up for yourself didn't work or if it's not safe to do so, then walk away from the situation, go somewhere safe, and seek support if needed.
 
 Seeking revenge against bullies is not a good idea. Using violence to solve problems only makes things worse and can put you in more danger.
 
 You deserve help. If bullying is impacting you to the point where you're struggling to cope and thinking about hurting yourself, contact your local crisis service. Crisis Services Canada has a 24/7 suicide prevention and support line, and a text chat service from 4pm-midnight.
 
 ""Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying 'I will try again tomorrow.'"" - Mary Anne Radmacher
 
 Read David's blog?about bullying and the law to learn about some of the different consequences and crimes that a person can be charged with for bullying.
 
 Be an upstander! If you witness bullying and it is safe to do so, step up - let the person doing the bullying know that their behaviour is not okay and that no one deserves to be treated that way.
 
 Distract the person doing the bullying by changing the conversation or by using humour. If you can, talk to them later in private and let them know that what they are doing is harmful! Bring support if you need it.
 
 Refuse to join in or watch. Don't give the bully an audience - instead, help the person being bullied to get to a safe place.
 
 Be supportive. If someone shares that they're being bullied, hear them out or help them find a supportive listener if it's not something you can take on.
 
 Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices. It includes sending, posting, or sharing negative or harmful content about someone else. It can also involve sharing personal or private information about someone else that causes embarrassment.

 You should feel safe and respected online. Learn about your rights when using social media by checking out our When You Click Agree Campaign.
 
 There are many ways to alter your social media habits to make the experience safer. Check out these healthy social media tips for some ideas.
 
 Keep evidence of cyberbullying. Record the dates, times, and descriptions of instances when cyberbullying has occurred. Save and print screenshots, emails, and text messages. Use this evidence to report cyberbullying to web and cell phone service providers.
 
 You can also report cyberbullying to the relevant social media platform so they can take action against users abusing their terms of service.
 
 Another way to help combat the effects of bullying is to remind the person that they matter! Read Elora's interview about the Don't Give Up Movement to find inspiration and learn how to make change in your school or community.
 
 Be Strong is a student-led anti-bullying initiative based in the US. Their website has lots of helpful resources and they have a free mobile app available for download!
 
 Sometimes, getting bullied can leave you feeling like there's something wrong with you. Read Leo Babauta's blog on how to work through that feeling and help shift that false mindset. You are whole and you are enough.
 
 Check out Ditch the Label, an international anti-bullying charity that provides resources and peer support for people who have been bullied and people who have bullied others.
 
 Another great anti-bullying initiative called Pink Shirt Day, is based in Canada. We did an interview with them earlier this year, give it a read here!
 
 Maybe you want to reach out for help, but have other things in addition to the bullying that you'd like to get support for. Here is a list of resources for general support.

271,0,"Coping with SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder)
 
 With leaves changing and the amount of daylight hours shrinking, it can feel dreary for anyone. For those with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), it can be even more difficult. These tips provide some insight and advice for getting through this change of season. They are not meant to replace professional advice or treatment.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs within the same season each year (usually, but not always, occurring during fall and winter) and then goes away or improves during the rest of the year. Learn more on our illness page, here.
 
 An estimated 2-3% of Canadians suffer with SAD. If you have episodes of depression that reoccur during the same season every year for more than 2 years, you might also have SAD and not just the occasional winter blues.
 
 In the clinical field, SAD has more recently been renamed ""depressive disorder with seasonal patterns"". Want to know more about this type of depression? Watch this helpful video. 
 
 If the sun is shining, take the opportunity to soak in the vitamin D! Natural light can be the best remedy.
 
 Make a proactive plan. Before your symptoms of SAD worsen, set a routine to follow. Schedule in time for hanging out with friends, exercising, and other self-care. You may not be able to fully prepare for your change in mood, but having some things set in place can make you feel more in control.
 
 Try aromatherapy! Essential oils can influence the area of the brain (limbic system) that's responsible for controlling moods and the body's internal clock. Try bergamot and lavender oils to help with symptoms of depression!
 
 Have you tried several different therapies but nothing seems to be working? Explore light therapy! There are many devices available, such as special light bulbs and light boxes that can help.
 
 Talk to your doctor! They can help you sort out if you have SAD, opposed to some other form of depression, or if something else is causing your symptoms. They can also help to create a treatment plan for you.
 
 Sticking to a schedule and trying to maintain regular sleep patterns will help you to see the light! Keeping a regular schedule will expose you to light at consistent and predictable times.
 
 Brighten up your space! Open your blinds to get natural light in, and decorate your surroundings with bright coloured decor.
 
 Having to take medication or supplements, such as vitamin D, for SAD does not make you weak. Make sure to keep up with your doses, as it will help you to feel more regulated when times are tough.
 
 Keep a journal! Release those negative thoughts by writing them down and getting them out of your brain.
 
 Eat the rainbow! Different colours of fruits and vegetables contain certain compounds, vitamins and minerals that each have their own health benefits. Getting a variety will ensure you're getting the most health benefits for your brain and overall wellness.
 
 Want to explore some non-traditional treatments? Try Reiki! Reiki treatments provide a gentle and supportive healing experience by balancing your chakras. Find a practitioner in your area and book a treatment!
 
 Make the most of the day! Wake up as early as you can so you can take in those rays of sunlight.
 
 Keep active to boost your mood and your energy! Try an activity like hot yoga or go for a jog outside in nature. It may seem impossible, but the exercise can help wonders.
 
 Some days you may not be able to leave your bed, and that's okay. Other days, try to do the opposite of what your illness wants. If it's telling you to stay inside and isolate, go out and visit a friend. This is known as opposite action and is a common skill taught in therapy.
 
 Plan ahead. As the winter months start rolling in, prepare for what's to come. Make a list of your coping strategies and supports for when you are faced with SAD.
 
 If you're not able to go on vacation to somewhere warm and sunny, practice guided imagery. Close your eyes and imagine yourself walking on a beach. What would it feel like to have the sun shining on your face and to feel the sand in your toes?
 
 Go outside your comfort zone and participate in some winter activities. There are many fun things to do that you might enjoy (e.g. renting skates at an ice rink, tobogganing, holiday crafts, making chili, etc.). These small acts can lift your spirits when you're feeling low.
 
 Reach out to those around you. You just might find out that they experience SAD too, or know someone who does. You're never alone.
 
 Try out photography. It may help you to see things, especially the winter months, from a different point of view.
 
 Creating traditions with family or friends may help you to make meaning during these difficult times.
 
 Download an app like Wisdo, to chat with people who are also struggling! Connecting with others and sharing your story can be incredibly healing experiences.
 
 Educate yourself! Read books, watch videos and research about SAD - as long as they are accurate sources of information! By having a better understanding of something, it can make it easier to talk about what is going on and to make changes in your life.
 
 Try a dawn simulator! Just like an alarm clock, but without the obnoxious noise! It produces light that gradually increases in intensity, just like the sun.
 
 Talk it out, whether one-on-one with a counsellor or at a support group! Having an outlet to share what's on your mind and how you're feeling can be a great relief.
 
 Did you have a favourite winter activity as a kid? Take some time to try it out again!
 
 SAD may cause you to feel hopeless. Download the Be Safe app to create a safety plan for when you may be in crisis.
 
 Sometimes you can't do it on your own and you may need medication to help you stabilize. That is okay! Talk to your doctor to explore your options.
 
 It's important to remind yourself that brighter days are to come. Spring is around the corner, so don't give up.

274,1,"Coping with Grief and Loss
 
 Losing someone close to you is life-changing and overwhelming. These tips are here to help you cope as your process your grief.
 
 Don't bottle up your feelings - losing someone is one of the hardest things you might experience, and it's important to talk about it. Even if people can't understand your loss, it's good to get your feelings off your chest.
 
 Death is only one reason for grief. Any loss can lead to grief whether it's ending a friendship, moving away, changing schools, etc. It depends what's important to you. Those losses are significant and life changing!
 
 Remember that everyone deals with grief differently. There is no right way to grieve, do what works for you.
 
 Don't put off the grieving process by using unhealthy coping methods to try to forget your pain. It is important to accept and face your grief. If you don't, it will build up and be harder to deal with in the future.
 
 Sometimes people feel relief when someone passes away, especially if they were sick for a long time or if they had a complicated relationship. It's OK to feel relieved, many people experience this and you are not alone. It doesn't make you a bad person.
 
 Know that anger, anxiety, numbness, helplessness and sadness are all normal reactions to loss. Accept these feelings - they will pass.
 
 Losing someone or something important to you is difficult. You might never fully ""get over"" your loss, but it will get easier and you will adjust to life without that person/thing.
 
 Try to keep your routine when you are going through grief. It will be a healthy distraction and help you feel better in the day to day. 
 
 Everyone grieves at their own pace. Don't feel bad if you are struggling longer than you feel you should. Give yourself the time you need.
 
 If you don't feel comfortable going to counselling, there are other ways to heal. You could write a letter to the person you lost or volunteer with a cause that was important to that person. Remember, if it gets too overwhelming, counselling might help!
 
 Ignore people who tell you how you are supposed to feel and let other people feel what they need to. Everyone grieves differently.
 
 There will be constant reminders of your loss like when it's time for holidays, specific places and anniversaries. Try to make lists of happier memories with that person, look at pictures and give yourself permission to feel down on those days.
 
 Helping others helps us feel better. Find some way to give back to your community by checking out this great resource. 
 
 Holidays can be hard after you've lost someone/something. Try starting a new tradition. Go to a new place, eat different food, do different activities. Distract yourself from your pain (which is ok) and help yourself chart a new course.
 
 Sometimes it feels like no one can understand what you're going through. If you don't feel ready to talk about your loss with other people, try journaling. It will help you feel a sense of release.
 
 Grief can overwhelm us. Make sure to remember the good things about that person. One way to do this is to eat their favourite foods, either on anniversaries or when you need to feel close to them.
 
 Humor is a powerful force. Give yourself permission to laugh and be happy, your loved one would want you to. Spend an afternoon watching your favourite funny TV show.
 
 Grief can be numbing. Try to get out and be active with exercise or going for a walk in nature. Physical health nurtures your mental health.
 
 Start a new hobby and try to become an expert at it! It will distract you from your loss while developing new skills and feeling pride in a new activity.
 
 Write stories with aspects of your loved one sprinkled throughout. This representation keeps their memory alive even if they aren't physically present.
 
 Set a manageable goal for yourself. This will lead to a change in routine and will give you something else to think about besides your loss. Taking care of yourself is very important during this time.
 
 Find people who have also experienced a loss. You could do this through a support group or check out The Dinner Party. 
 
 Try living your life the way your loved one would have wanted you to. Grief will be constantly evolving as time passes. Do your best!

277,0,"Letting Go of the Past and Moving Forward
 
 Are you struggling to let go of the past and move forward? These tips will help you through this difficult process.
 
 Mistakes are a way to learn as we grow. Reflecting on past mistakes to make different decisions in the future can be beneficial!
 
 Memories fade for a reason and details are forgotten. That mistake you made back then might be distorted over time. Self talk: ""I made that mistake. It's over. There's nothing I can do but move forward.""
 
 ""Tomorrow is always fresh, with no mistakes in it."" - Lucy Maud Montgomery, Anne of Green Gables
 
 Worrying is a trigger that tells you to fix something. Try making a plan (step by step) to identify and attempt to resolve those issues.
 
 Talk face to face with someone who has bothered you rather than through text or email.You will walk away feeling better about the conversation.
 
 If you find yourself dwelling on something, give yourself a time limit: ""I will give this worry 10 minutes of my time, and then I'm done."" Distract yourself with something new once the time is up.
 
 Plan out some healthy, positive, self care goals to complete this week. Write them down where you can see them or set reminders on your phone. This will help you focus on the good in your life.
 
 Feel like you need closure but no longer have contact with someone? Write a letter to them and destroy it afterwards. Or talk out loud as if they are in the room with you. It's weird, but might work!
 
 Reflect on situations that have resulted in hurt feelings. Is there anything you could have done differently? You can't change the past, but you can learn from it.
 
 It's natural for our minds to relive the past. When this happens, acknowledge the memory, forgive yourself, and refocus your attention to the here and now.
 
 Are you surrounded by an environment, things or people that remind you of your past? Try to change it up; spend time in different places, donate things linked to bad memories and try to widen your social circle.
 
 The pain you are feeling right now will pass. Pain is a sign of growth. It will get better.
 
 Don't dwell on the negative aspects of the past, and instead focus on what is positive about the present. Try making a list of a few things in your life you are grateful for.
 
 If the uncertainty of the future is making you anxious, you might need some mindfulness techniques to help focus on the here and now so you can focus on doing your best today.
 
 Letting go can be difficult. This guided meditation can make the process a bit easier.
 
 Is there someone who encourages and supports you? Take some time to thank them, whether it's a thank you card, surprise picnic or a big hug. Focusing on the positive will take your mind off the negative for a while.
 
 Part of moving forward is trying new things. During this process, remind yourself that there is no right or wrong way to do anything. If you find a way that works for you, go for it!
 
 Your inner critic can be mean! Fight back and challenge your thoughts: ""I know that I'm great at these three things!"" Having a more balanced view of yourself will help you move on with confidence.
 
 Are you overwhelmed by the thought of moving on? Make a plan of action and break big steps into smaller steps. Try to do something each day to get you a little closer to your goals.
 
 Part of moving forward is making choices that are right for you. If you struggle to make decisions here are some tips.
 
 You are the only person who has to live your life. You have control over your actions. Do what's right for you regardless of what people say. Doing something to gain approval will not make you happy in the long run.
 
 Sometimes fear can hold us back. Reflect on your fears: ""What's the worst thing that could happen? What's the best thing that could happen?"" Plan how you will deal with fear and then push through.
 
 Moving forward is hard work. Do the people around you bring you down or pump you up? If they bring you down, find some positive people to surround yourself with.
 
 Recognize that everyone is doing the best they can. If someone failed you or you failed yourself, recognize the effort and readjust your expectations. This will help you forgive yourself and others.
 
 Think about what you want to achieve in life. Try focusing on one goal at a time and break it into smaller steps. Having something to work towards will help you move forward.
 
 When you feel overwhelmed by change, don't give up; take a break instead. Engage in activities that are comforting and allow you to recharge.
 
 Focus on what you enjoy and try to determine if there is a way to make it a bigger part of your life. Do you like hanging out with adventurous people? Start rock climbing. Like cooking? Find a community kitchen or cooking class.
 
 Instead of focusing on what you can't do, focus on what you can do. This will help you feel like you are making progress.
 
 If you feel stuck, confused and overwhelmed, take a short, brisk walk. The exercise and fresh air will do you good. You might be able to think more clearly afterwards.
 
 Self doubt can get in the way. Just remember you have what it takes to get through hard times and succeed. Here is a quick yoga sequence to pump yourself up!

 Spring is a great time for fresh starts, whether that means tidying up some of the chaos in your mind or in your environment!
 
 Are there things that are holding you back in life? Focus on healthy boundaries with others and self care as a start.
 
 Write down one day this month that you will clean out your closet and donate clothes you haven't worn in a long time.
 
 Organize your bookshelves in different ways. You could arrange books in a rainbow to add some colour to a wall or do white and black alternating.
 
 Make your bedroom your sanctuary. No matter how difficult the outside world might be, make your bedroom your calming safe place. Add art work on the walls, add pillows on the bed, paint a wall a bright colour and add some twinkle lights.

 Feeling sluggish? Observe what zaps you of energy. Stop doing those things if you can avoid it. If you can't stop them, think about how you could plan your schedule to accommodate these energy zapping activities.

 The food we eat has an impact on our mental health. Make your kitchen easy to cook in, clear your counter so you have space to work, and put the newest items at the back of the fridge so you don't forget about the older ones before they go bad!
 
 Acknowledge your effort, not your success. You are a success because you try, not because life comes easy.
 
 Had conflict with an important person in your life? If you feel ready, reach out and make the first move. Clear the air and focus your energy elsewhere once you have made that step.
 
 Live in the moment. Savour your current accomplishments rather than stressing about next steps.
 
 The world is noisy, make sure you take some quiet time. Take a hike, take a bath or just turn off the TV and relish the silence.

309,0,"Building Positive Self-Esteem
 
 It's easy to get down on yourself when things don't go as planned. The important thing is how you react and how you feel about yourself afterwards.
 
 Treat yourself like a friend. Whenever you feel like being critical, be supportive and loving instead.
 
 Make a list of things you love about yourself. Whenever you feel bad, look at it and focus on your strengths.
 
 Accept when you make mistakes. Rather than belittling yourself, focus on improving yourself for next time.
 
 Try not to project your worries on others. You might think the worst of yourself, but most people won't notice.
 
 Speak to others respectfully and expect the same in return. Tell people if you are offended by what they say.
 
 Set realistic goals and reassess them as needed. Don't beat yourself up for expectations that were unreachable.
 
 It's okay to be disappointed in yourself sometimes but realize your self worth isn't your grades or your job.
 
 Keep a book of positive notes for when you're feeling down. Look back on past accomplishments.
 
 Asking for help is not a sign of weakness -- it's a sign of strength and willingness to grow. Be proud.
 
 Don't rely on others to build self-worth. Congratulate and reward yourself for good work, even if no one notices.
 
 Borrow a library book about self-confidence. Feeling informed can be a great way to increase confidence.
 
 Respect yourself and your values. Surround yourself with people who do the same.
 
 Try to eat better. What you put in your body affects your mood and how you feel about yourself.
 
 Credit yourself for your efforts. Even if you don't achieve a goal, congratulate yourself for trying valiantly.
 
 Changing how you see yourself will not happen overnight-- accept that this is a lifetime goal. You're on your way!
 
 Take time to celebrate your achievements. Even if it's something little, it can have a huge effect.
 
 Everyone struggles with esteem sometimes, even people who pretend they don't care. You are not alone.
 
 Focus on having fun. Don't let your fears hold you back from participating and doing the things you love.
 
 Be patient with others and don't put them down. Change your reaction to others; change your reaction to yourself.
 
 Don't let one negative thought spiral into others. One bad grade means you did bad once; that's all. It's from our mistakes that we learn the most. 
 
 Live in the present. Tomorrow might be better or worse, but the best you can do is prepare for today.
 
 Let yourself feel your negative emotions, but don't get swept up in it. Emotions should come and go.
 
 Accept the things you can't change. Focus on what you can do to improve and leave the negative behind.
 
 Silence your inner critic. If your first thought is a negative one, try re-framing and hoping for the best.
 
 You have weaknesses, and that's okay! You are still worthy in spite of your faults. Never forget it.
 
 Try new things. Take pride in your new skills and the effort you dedicated to improving.
 
 Think in the 3rd person. It's silly, but people are more forgiving of others. Calling yourself by name CAN help!
 
 Help someone who needs it. You might find that making a difference makes you feel better about yourself.
 
 Exercise for the emotional payoff. Moving around doing something you love and don't belittle your efforts.
 
 Repeat positive phrases to yourself daily. Over time, you'll start to believe them and see your own worth.

 Everything You Need to Know About Depression
 
 This resource is powered by TeenMentalHealth.org. Check out their website for more information and resources.
 
 Everyone has bad days. It's perfectly normal to feel low when something bad happens (e.g., you break up with your boyfriend / girlfriend or fail an exam). If your low mood persists over a long period of time however, and it starts affecting your ability to succeed in your daily life (or is making you feel that life is not worth living), you may be experiencing clinical depression. If you think you or someone you know may be clinically depressed, it's a good idea to make an appointment with your school counsellor or family doctor.
 
 There can be a lot of confusion when people use the word depression. Sometimes the word is used to mean almost any type of negative feeling (e.g., lonely, unhappy, sad, despondent, demoralized, disgruntled). When a health provider uses the word depression, they don't mean a mood, they mean a mental disorder, and sometimes they use the phrase ""clinical depression."" In this resource, the word ""depression"" means a clinical depression, not a negative feeling.
 
 Are ?there ?different ?types ?of ?depression?
 
 Yes, there are multiple types of depression. This resource will focus on Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymic Disorder, and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), because they're the depressive disorders most likely to affect college/university students.
 
 Facts
 
 About 5% of men and 10% of women will experience Major Depressive Disorder at some point in their life.
 
 At any given time, almost 3 million Canadians have depression but less than 1/3 of those people seek help.
 
 Depression can be treated successfully with therapy and medication.
 
 What? are ?the ?symptoms? of ?different ?types ?of ?depression?
 
 MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD)
 
 To be diagnosed with MDD, you must have either (a) an intense and persistent low (or irritable) mood or (b) a lack of interest or pleasure in the things you usually like, every day for at least 2 weeks. You also must have at least 5 of the symptoms listed below. These symptoms need to significantly interfere with your ability to live a normal life. Sometimes people with this kind of depression experience psychosis, which means their thinking is detached from reality. The symptoms are:
 
 ? Gaining or losing a significant amount of weight
 
 ? Sleeping much more or much less than usual
 
 ? Extreme restlessness or lack of movement noticed by others
 
 ? Feeling really tired or lacking energy
 
 ? Feeling worthless or inappropriately guilty (i.e., when you haven't done anything wrong)
 
 ? Extreme difficulty concentrating or making decisions
 
 ? Frequent thoughts of death or suicide, suicide plan, attempted suicide
 
 ? Feeling hopeless
 
 DYSTHYMIC DISORDER
 
 This is very similar to MDD except that it is less severe and may last years without being diagnosed. The person may be able to get through daily functioning (with some struggle) but still has problems with his or her mood. The symptoms are:
 
 * Depressed mood most of the day, more days than not, for at least 1 to 2 years
 
 * Many of the additional symptoms listed above
 
 SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER (SAD), A.K.A. MDD WITH SEASONAL PATTERN
 
 This is a type of depression that usually occurs at certain times of the year, often in fall and winter when there is less sunlight. The symptoms are:
 
 * Same symptoms as above, but person has periods without any symptoms at characteristic times of year (often spring and summer).
 
 * Needs to happen for more than one year to be diagnosed (otherwise, it's not a pattern).
 
 How? is ?depression ?treated?
 
 Depression is very treatable, using psychological therapies and/or medication. Often psychotherapy and medication will be prescribed together. Treatments should be provided by a qualified health professional, using best evidence interventions (i.e., interventions that have been supported by good-quality research). For depressive disorders, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)  and some medications called selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are supported by research and have been found to be very effective. To help you with getting the treatment you need, check out this resource:

 In addition to psychotherapy and medication, you can help yourself by doing activities that will help fight negative feelings. It can be hard to feel motivated to do things on your own, but trying the tips listed on the next page will really make a difference in how you feel. If you don't have depression, these tips can also be really helpful if you're feeling stressed out, upset, or down.
 
 Tips ?to ?fight ?negative ?feelings? and? to ?help ?with ?treatments ?for? any ?mental ?illness
 
 Go outside! Staying inside all the time, especially in winter, can be really draining. Getting outside and enjoying the sun and fresh air can lift your spirits.
 
 * Exercise -Try to get at least a half hour of vigorous physical activity (e.g., a brisk walk) each day.
 
 * Be social - Get out there! Even if you're not in the mood, you may find that being out with people you like helps you to feel better.
 
 * Stop thinking so much - Too much over analyzing and ruminating about things makes you feel worse. Turn off your brain, just for a little bit.
 
 * Talk - Talk to people you can trust about your feelings and concerns. Sharing your feelings with someone else can feel like a weight is lifted off your chest.
 
 * Relax - Take time for yourself everyday. Consider trying yoga, meditation, or breathing exercises.
 
 * Eat healthy - Eating a balanced diet gives your body the fuel it needs to combat stress. Try not to skip meals and go easy on the junk food. Check out  www.choosemyplate.gov for some good information on healthy eating. They even have a program called SuperTracker that helps you plan out what you should be eating each day.
 
 * Stay away from alcohol and drugs - Alcohol and many drugs are depressants, which mean that they may actually worsen your depressive feelings.
 
 * Laugh - Watch a funny movie or funny videos. Talk to someone who makes you laugh. Exposing yourself to things that make you happy is an important part of feeling better.
 
 * Problem solve - Take control. Consider one problem at a time and plan out possible solutions. Ask someone you trust to help you brainstorm. Don't try to deal with everything all at once; that's the fastest way to feel overwhelmed.
 
 * Structure your day - Give yourself something to do, even if you start small. Even activities like showering, walking the dog, or making lunch can make you feel better. Having some structure in your day makes a big difference in how you feel. Keeping a daily diary or schedule can be a big help, especially if you're a visual person.
 
 * Get enough sleep - You need about nine hours per night.
 
 Tips? for? helping ?others
 
 If someone you care about has depression, the best and most important thing you can do is support them. In order to support someone else, you also need to look after yourself. Here are a few pointers:
 
 * Educate yourself - Understanding what depression is and how it affects the person you care about will help you be less frustrated and more supportive.
 
 * Encourage your friend to seek help - Having someone he/she can trust, like you, is so important. But someone trying to cope with a mental disorder also needs treatment. Encourage them to see a doctor or psychologist to get the help he/she needs. Even if the problems don't seem that bad yet, seeking help early can prevent problems from getting worse.
 
 * Listen - When you listen to and acknowledge their feelings, it sends the message that you care. Knowing that you have people who care about you is an important part of recovering from a mental disorder.
 
 * Be positive - Positive moods can be contagious! It's really easy for someone with a mental disorder to focus only on the negative aspects of his/her life. Sharing your positive mood may help them see things from a different perspective.
 
 * Be patient - Sometimes it can be frustrating when they start acting differently and may not want to do anything they used to like. Take a deep breath and remember that depression is making them feel this way. He/she can't just ""snap out of it."" Getting impatient will only make the situation worse. Stay positive and be patient. Encourage them to participate in social events. He/she may feel like it's too much work or effort, but will probably feel better afterwards.
 
 * Don't blame yourself - It is not your fault that they have depression. Many different factors, including his/her genetic background, environment, and life experiences are involved. No one can ""make"" another person have depression.
 
 * Put yourself first - On an airplane, they tell you to always put your oxygen mask on first in an emergency before you assist someone else. You'll be no help to anyone if you're passed out. With someone with a mental illness, if you burn yourself out by always putting him or her first, you won't be able to help anyone. It's absolutely okay (and important) to take time away to take care of yourself.
 
 * Don't try to change your friend - You don't have to solve all of their problems or turn him/her into a different kind of person. Just be present and supportive.
 
 * Have fun together - They need someone who can have fun, relax, and laugh with him/her. These are all important parts of their mental health (and yours!).
 
 * Be aware of suicide risk - If they talk about death or suicide, don't ignore it or keep it a secret. Talk to a responsible adult who they also trust (e.g., residence assistant, counsellor, coach, professor). Let them know that you care about him/her and his/her life. If they are talking about suicide, it may be his or her way of indirectly asking for help.

 This resource is powered by TeenMentalHealth.org. Check out their website for more information and resources.
 
 Suicide should always be taken seriously, as it is one of the leading causes of death among young people. If you hear someone talking about suicide, it may be a cry for help and it is important to take it seriously.
 
 Why? would? someone ?want? to ?die ?by ?suicide?
 
 Suicide is complex and often misunderstood. In Canada, most people who die from suicide have a mental disorder. Suicide or suicidal thoughts is not a normal response to stress or sadness, nor is it part of being a ""normal teenager."" Some people think that suicidal behaviours are just a cry for attention, but regardless of the complex reasons behind the behaviour, it is important to get them professional help. Suicide is a very serious issue.
 
 I think? my? friend? is? suicidal
 
 If you think someone is suicidal, it is important that you listen and take him/her seriously. Your friend needs to know that you care and that it matters to you whether he or she lives or dies. Accept that your friend's feelings are very real, even if they don't make sense to you.
 
 You should see a counselor for information and advice on how to approach your friend. You can also try to get your friend to visit the counselor with you there for support.
 
 Suicide? warning? signs
 
 Here are some warning signs that someone may be considering suicide:
 
 ? Talk about what it will be like for others after they're gone
 
 ? Suicidal thoughts
 
 ? Preoccupation with death
 
 ? Withdrawal from family and friends
 
 ? Intense hopelessness or sadness
 
 ? Giving away valued possessions
 
 If you notice these signs in someone you care about, ask if he or she is thinking about suicide. Asking about suicide directly will not put the idea into his/her head. Be polite and respectful but don't beat around the bush. Be direct, keep an open mind, and try not to be judgmental. Remember that no matter how you feel about the situation, your friend's feelings are real and valid. Asking your friend about suicide shows that you care enough to have a potentially uncomfortable conversation. Your friend will likely be relieved that you asked, knowing that he or she is not alone.
 
 Know the signs! Call 911 or take your friend to the emergency room at the hospital if he or she needs immediate help. Do not wait! Take all threats of suicide very seriously!

338,1,"LOW MOOD & DEPRESSION: THE BASICS
 
 Start here to find out more about low mood and depression.
 
 What is It?
 
 Everyone feels sad, down, or from time to time. Problems, disappointments, and losses can affect anyone's mood. Most often these feelings are temporary. But, when low mood goes on for more than a few weeks and other symptoms appear (having no energy, wanting to be alone) this could be a sign of depression. The longer it lasts, the more likely it is to get in the way of school, work, family, friends, and your daily life.
 
 What can lead to depression?
 
 There is no single cause of depression. It often develops because of a combination of things:
 
 ? Life events or stress (for example losing someone close to you)
 
 ? Biological factors - hormones, family history, genetics
 
 ? Medical illness or certain medications
 
 ? Ways of thinking that make someone more likely to experience stress
 
 What you can do if you've been feeling sad or down
 
 It's easier to deal with the challenges of low mood when they're recognized early. You can take action on your own or with support from friends, family or professionals.
 
 * Explore the ""What Next"" options below to learn about the early signs and help you decide on steps you can take.

340,1,"DEPRESSION & SUBSTANCE USE
 
 Discover how alcohol and other substances affect depression.
 
 Depression and drinking or using other substances
 
 People with problems like depression may try using alcohol or other substances as a way to feel better. Some may not be aware that they are struggling with depression, and they only notice that they feel good after they have had a few drinks or have used substances.
 
 Even though it feels like it might be drinking alcohol or using other substances can actually make depression worse. They only provide short-term relief, and their negative effects can cause more problems. You might be able to forget your troubles for a few hours, but you aren't building any long-term skills or strategies to deal with the challenges of depression.
 
 Some facts
 
 ? Alcohol lowers a person's mood because it is actually a depressant.
 
 ? Alcohol and other substances only cover up symptoms for short time and in the long run they can make symptoms worse.
 
 ? The brain has the ability to achieve the same feelings of well-being that people get from drinking or using other substances.

 Grief is what you experience when you lose something or someone close to you.
 
 LEARN MOREkeyboard_arrow_down
 
 What is Grief?
 
 People often associate grief with the death of a pet or loved one. But, people can experience grief after any important loss in their life.
 
 People may feel grief when they:
 
 ? lose a loved one (family member, friend or pet)
 
 ? break up with a partner
 
 ? move away
 
 ? have family members who divorce
 
 ? lose a job
 
 ? lose an important possession
 
 ? are diagnosed with a life-changing or terminal illness or disability
 
 ? lose their spirituality
 
 ? have something good happen that will mean leaving something behind they enjoyed. For example, moving up to high school can be fun and exciting, but you may also grieve the loss of your old school and teachers.
 
 Grief is natural after a loss, but the way in which people experience grief can look and feel very different. Grief affects people emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually. Many people start to feel better as time passes, but certain events, holidays or hearing about other peoples' losses can make these feelings reappear. The most important thing to do when coping with loss is to talk about it.
 
 Common Reactions to Grief
 
 Feelings of grief can be very complicated and not everyone grieves in the same way. Whatever you feel, it is important to know that there is no 'right' way to grieve. It is important to let yourself 'feel' rather than try to hide from or ignore your feelings or act 'normal'. Feelings of grief can sometimes feel like a rollercoaster as you experience different emotions. It is normal for one loss to stir up other losses we have had.  For example, if your grandmother dies you may find yourself thinking about when your grandfather died or when your pet got lost. Give yourself the space and time to grieve as you will eventually start to feel better as time passes.
 
 Everyone has different feelings, thoughts and reactions to grief, including:
 
 * Physical reactions: Headaches, tiredness, numbness, crying a lot, unable to relax, nausea.
 
 * Emotional reactions: Sad, angry, anxious, lonely, disbelief, despair, guilt, relief.
 
 * Mental reactions: Forgetful, distracted, confused, worried about the health and safety of others, difficulty making decisions, poor memory.
 
 * Behavioural reactions: Changes to sleeping patterns, dreams or nightmares, or to appetite. You might or might not want to go out or be around people. You may also experience unusual emotional reactions or feel weepy.
 
 * Social reactions: Staying away from friends or pretending like nothing has happened because you don't know what to say or think you need to be seen as strong. Some friends may avoid you because they don't know what to say or how to help you.
 
 * Spiritual reactions: Have doubts about your faith or beliefs. Blame a higher power for allowing this to happen.

352,1,"LIVING WITH LOSS
 
 The process of grieving does not have a time limit and there is no one 'right' way to grieve. It is important to find healthy ways to cope with the pain of loss, and know these strategies can change over time.
 
 Ways to help you cope and manage grief and loss
 
 People cope with grief in different ways just like everyone expresses grief in their own way. Some techniques for coping may work for you and others may not. You may find that how you cope also changes over time. Most importantly, you need to give yourself the space and time each day to grieve.
 
 Some techniques include a quiet space where you are alone and others include family members and friends.  Sometimes you may need even more support.  A visit to a healthcare professional is also a great option. See the Get Support section for more information. You may never get over a loss completely, but you will start to feel better over time.  You will learn to cope and grief will not be so all consuming. And remember that grief does not follow a straight line, where you grieve and then it is over.  You may start to feel better and then something will remind you of your loss and you may have more upsetting feelings again. This is normal and may happen a few times before the grieving becomes small enough to intrude less on your life.
 
 Here are some tips and techniques that may help you cope with your grief.
 
 Tips:
 
 ? Give yourself the space and time.
 
 ? Connect with caring and supportive people. Let yourself receive hugs if you are comfortable with that (connection softens grief).
 
 ? Let yourself feel what you are feeling and be honest with yourself and others about those feelings.
 
 ? Take care of yourself (self-care); eat well, get enough sleep and exercise, spend time with family and friends.
 
 ? Reach out for help. Grieving can be lonely and you are not alone!
 
 Techniques:
 
 * Let yourself cry, if you can.
 
 * Let yourself remember funny times and laugh.
 
 * Keep a journal.
 
 * Put together a photo-book or collage.
 
 * Make a memory box with pictures and mementos.
 
 * Take part in prayer, a healing circle or other faith based rituals.
 
 * Attend the funeral or celebration of life, or create your own special ritual to honour the person's memory. For example, visit a place they loved or do something that was important to them.
 
 * Talk to someone you trust.
 
 * Talk to someone who has had a similar loss (a family member, friend or support group).
 
 * Light a candle in memory of the person on a special day (birthday, holidays or anniversary).
 
 If you do not take the time or the space to grieve, it can lead to depression and stop you from moving forward in life. Moving forward doesn't mean forgetting. You don't ever truly 'get over it', but the loss is something that you can come to terms with over time and accept. Many people are surprised that as they start to feel better a feeling of guilt can creep in. It's important to give yourself permission to feel better. That doesn't mean you are forgetting the loss, but that you are accepting it. It is okay to move forward and find happiness again.  Most people find that the times they feel sad and the strength of their sad feelings will lessen over time.

 It is very painful and complicated to lose someone to suicide.
 
 Everyone deals with loss in their own way and at their own pace. Be patient with yourself and know there are resources to support you during this difficult time.  Get support from a counsellor. Find a suicide loss support group.
 
 If you are in crisis right now call the BC Suicide Help Line 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433).
 
 Trying to understand ""why""
 
 After a suicide, it is common to want to understand why it happened. Sadly, you will probably never have a satisfactory answer to this question. Suicide is complex and there is not usually one thing that caused the suicide. You will need to be okay with not knowing the answer to the question ""why"".
 
 Understand your feelings
 
 While you grieve you may feel angry, confused, alone, guilty or numb. These are all common feelings after losing someone to suicide and they may come and go. Accept how you are feeling and be patient with yourself while you deal with these painful feelings.
 
 Reach out
 
 When you are ready, reach out to people you trust and be open with them. Talking about your loss can help you to understand your feelings. If you aren't comfortable reaching out to someone you know, contact the BC Bereavement Helpline at 1-877-779-2223?or talk to a counsellor. Find more information in our Get Support section.
 
 Take care of yourself
 
 Try to get back to your hobbies and social life. If some of it doesn't feel right, try a new hobby. Always remember to take care of yourself. How are you feeling? Are you eating right, exercising and getting enough sleep? All these things will help you and are important during this difficult time.

 It can be hard to know what to say or do to support a friend or loved one who is dealing with a loss.
 
 LEARN MOREkeyboard_arrow_down
 
 They probably feel alone and that no one understands, so it is important to let them know that you are there for them, even if you are working through your own feelings of grief.
 
 What Grief can look like
 
 Your friend or loved one may find it difficult to describe their feelings and may show their grief by:
 
 ? acting out or being angry
 
 ? crying
 
 ? staying away from family, friends, society, etc.
 
 ? loss of appetite
 
 ? having problems focusing
 
 ? acting like nothing is wrong; trying hard to look 'normal'
 
 ? hiding their feelings or avoiding them by keeping very busy
 
 ? worrying about dying or losing others close to them
 
 ? turning to alcohol, other drugs or risky behaviours  (numbing the pain or 'testing' death)
 
 Any of these behaviours may seem out of character and upsetting. And their behaviour may also change quickly. It is important to make your friend or loved one feel safe, secure and cared for. If you are worried or scared for your friend or loved one at any time, please reach out to a trusted adult for support. You do not need to support them on your own.
 
 What you can do for a friend or loved one
 
 With a shoulder to cry on or a listening ear. Ask what they need and remind them that you are there for them.
 
 * Don't avoid talking about the loss. It can be helpful to share stories and memories along with feelings.
 
 * Check in. Ask them what they need and how they are doing. Even if they don't respond, remind them that you are there for them and understand they need to follow their own path through the grieving process.
 
 * Get them out of the house. Even if they are likely to say ""no"", invite them out to social events or spend some time together. Get them thinking about something else. It is important for them to know they are still important to you and to others. That It's okay to have some fun and doesn't take away from the importance of the loss.
 
 * Connect them with help. If your friend or loved is really struggling, help them connect with some support services.Be there.
 
 * Take care of yourself too. It can be challenging to support someone who is grieving. Make sure to take care of your own well-being and get extra support if you need it.
 
 * 
 
 What to say to a grieving friend or loved
 
 It can be hard to know what to say, and nothing you say will bring back what has been lost, but simple words can bring comfort.
 
 Some comforting words to say:
 
 * I'm so sorry to hear of your loss.
 
 * I'm sorry you are hurting.
 
 * I am here for you if you want to talk.
 
 * It is okay to cry.
 
 * Is there anything that I can do?
 
 * Do you want to take a walk and talk about it?
 
 Actions often talk louder than words. Hug your friend or loved one if you are having problems with knowing what to say.
 
 What 'not' to say or do when a friend or loved is grieving
 
 Think about what you would like to say or do before you speak. That can make the situation more comfortable and thoughtful for both of you.
 
 Some things to avoid:
 
 * Don't tell them to cheer up or that they will get over it.
 
 * Don't ignore or avoid them.
 
 * Don't check in too often. People who are grieving often need some space and time, so check-in, but be mindful not to smother them (this includes in-person, texts and emails).
 
 * Don't take it personally if your friend/loved one avoids you or declines your invites.

355,1,"WHAT IS SELF-INJURY?
 
 Self-injury is when a person hurts themself on purpose to help deal with difficult thoughts or feelings.
 
 Self-injury is when a person intentionally hurts themself to help deal with difficult thoughts or feelings. A person who self-injures is not trying to end their life, but rather they are trying to cope with or communicate their distress. They may feel numb to the world and are using self-injury as a way to feel something. Some people who self-injure may have suicidal thoughts, but this is not always the case.
 
 A person can have one or more reasons for self-injuring. These reasons may develop and change over time.
 
 Common reasons for self-injuring include:
 
 ? to cope with grief, loss, violence, chronic illness or major stressors
 
 ? to deal with unwanted feelings like anxiety or depression
 
 ? to punish themself
 
 ? to express feelings of failure, anger or self-hate
 
 ? to make emotional distress feel like physical pain
 
 ? to feel something, instead of feeling nothing or feeling numb
 
 ? to feel in control of something when other things feel out of control
 
 ? to feel better at that moment or feel a release of tension
 
 ? to avoid dealing with a stressful situation
 
 ? to communicate distress, a need for help or the feeling that they can't be helped
 
 Self-injury is usually very private and can be really hard to talk about. Common types of self-injury are:
 
 * cutting or scratching the skin
 
 * carving words or symbols into the skin
 
 * rubbing objects into the skin
 
 * burning the skin
 
 * biting or severely pinching the skin
 
 * self hitting
 
 * crashing or banging into objects
 
 * picking at sores on the skin
 
 * hair-pulling
 
 When someone is self-injuring it may seem like a less harmful way to deal with their thoughts and feelings. But self-injury is still harmful to the individual.
 
 Those who stop self-injuring say they:
 
 * are working on addressing the underlying issues that lead to the self-injury
 
 * are better able to handle their emotions
 
 * have become more self-aware
 
 * are getting support from others
 
 What you can do if you have been self-injuring
 
 For some, the urge to self-injure can be very strong. But, there are places to get help and ideas for healthy ways to cope.
 
 * Where to get help:
 
 * Talk to someone you trust like a family member, teacher or coach.
 
 * Talk to a professional like a doctor or counsellor.
 
 * Use phone and online support services.
 
 * Check out the Tips for Talking with Someone to help you start the conversation.
 
 * Here are some ways to start?managing self-injury at home.
 
 If wounds from self-injury look serious
 
 * In an emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.
 
 * If not an immediate emergency call 811 to speak with a nurse.
 
 * Make sure you care for any injuries properly, keep basic first aid supplies on hand.
 
 * See your doctor if you're not sure what to do next.

 Self-injury is usually very private and can be really hard to talk about. When you first find out a friend is self-injuring it can be difficult to understand and tough to deal with. You have already taken the first step to helping by reading this information. Just being there and offering support can be a huge help. But, know your limits. Know when you are able to help and when you need to encourage your friend to reach out for more help. Make sure you take care of yourself and your needs too. Remember to be patient with your friend and remember it is not your fault.
 
 Some ways you can help a friend who is self-injuring are:
 
 ? Reach out. Talk to your friend. Let them know you are worried and you care about them. But be prepared for any reaction. They may not be ready to talk quite yet, but knowing they can talk to you is important. Check out these Tips for talking with your friend for more ideas.
 
 ? Listen to what they have to say in a non-judgemental way. Try not to look at their behaviour as ""good"", ""bad"" or ""weird"". Instead, be understanding, and try not to tell them what to do.
 
 ? Share information. Tell your friend about any websites or other resources you have found helpful. Let them know you can be there if they look at these resources or just a phone call away if they would like to look at them on their own.
 
 ? Support your friend when they are ready to reach out for more help. Offer to come with them to talk with a parent, caregiver, doctor, counsellor or coach.
 
 * If your friend has not reached out for other help, encourage them to do so. Suggest they reach out to a trusted adult such as a school counsellor, doctor, coach, or peer support worker.
 
 ? Do not promise to keep their self injury a secret. You don't want your friend to feel betrayed if you need to reach out to a trusted adult to take care of yourself or if you are really worried about your friend.
 
 ? Take care of yourself. Supporting others when they're struggling can often affect us as well. It is important that you make sure you have time and energy for your own needs. Don't feel guilty about taking some space to recharge.

 If you think someone you know is considering suicide:
 
 ? Talk to them. Find a good time and place to talk to your friend. Let them know you are worried about them, you care about them and you are there to support them.
 
 * Ask open-ended questions to help them talk about what's going on for them, such as ""I've noticed you are feeling sad quite a bit. Can we talk about what's going on?""
 
 ? Ask about suicide directly. Ask them directly if they are thinking of suicide or if they have a plan for how they would kill themself. Know that asking them about suicide won't give them the idea to kill themselves.
 
 * ""You seem really down and I heard you say you wish you were dead. Sometimes when people are feeling this way, they are thinking of suicide. Are you thinking about suicide?""
 
 ? Never promise to keep a suicide plan a secret. Let your friend know you are there for them and you care about them but if you are concerned about their safety you will have to talk to someone.
 
 ? Encourage them to talk to someone. They can reach out to a family member, school counsellor or mental health professional. You can also call the BC Suicide Help Line 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) with your friend or if you need help.

 Understand your feelings
 
 While you grieve you may feel angry, confused, alone, guilty or numb. These are all common feelings after losing someone to suicide and they may come and go. Accept how you are feeling and be patient with yourself while you deal with these painful feelings.
 
 Reach out
 
 When you are ready, reach out to people you trust and be open with them. Talking about your loss can help you to understand your feelings.

 Take care of yourself
 
 Try to get back to your hobbies and social life. If some of it doesn't feel right, try a new hobby. Always remember to take care of yourself. How are you feeling? Are you eating right, exercising and getting enough sleep? All these things will help you and are important during this difficult time.

 ? depression
 
 ? emotional health
 
 ? sadness
 
 Are you worried a friend may be experiencing depression? If you're concerned about your friend's mental health, there are things you can do and/or say to support them while taking care of your own well-being. Here are some ideas and things to consider.
 
 Is my friend experiencing depression?
 
 Depression is a common mental disorder. It can cause people to experience low mood for an extended period of time - it's more than just the daily ups and downs everyone has. Signs your friend may be experiencing depression include:
 
 * being sad or down most days
 
 * crying a lot (or more often than they usually do)
 
 * being irritable or angry
 
 * avoiding activities they used to enjoy
 
 * withdrawing from friends and family
 
 * using substances to cope with their feelings
 
 * other signs and symptoms
 
 It can be difficult to tell exactly what someone may be going through. While you may be concerned about your friend, it's important to remember the signs of depression may vary from person to person. Keep in mind that depression also has different types, and can only be diagnosed by a psychologist, psychiatrist or doctor.
 
 What can I do to support my friend?
 
 It's OK to open up a conversation about depression - and more generally, mental health and well-being - with your friend. By starting the discussion, you may be easing any pressure from your friend if they're afraid to bring it up. Here are some ways you can approach your friend and offer support:
 
 1. Just be there
 
 Reach out and check in with your friend about how they're feeling. Just being there can show them how much you care. Remind them they're not on their own. Let them know there is hope and help is available if they need it.
 
 You can say:
 
 * ""You seem really down lately. Do you want to talk about it?""
 
 * ""You've been crying a lot recently, and I'm worried about you. How are you feeling?""
 
 * ""I noticed you quit playing hockey. Is everything OK?""
 
 * ""I care about you. What's been going on lately?""
 
 2. Listen carefully
 
 Listen to what your friend is willing to share with you. You can try repeating in your own words what they tell you to confirm your understanding. Depending on what they tell you, saying things like this may help them feel heard and understood in the moment:
 
 * ""That must be really hard.""
 
 * ""I'm so sorry you're hurting.""
 
 * ""I'm here for you.""
 
 3. Research depression
 
 You can look up depression to see if there are helpful facts to know and share with your friend. For example, experiencing depression doesn't mean you're lazy or weak. It's as real and as serious as a physical condition. Taking care of your mental and emotional health is just as important as taking care of your body. Depression is also treatable with things like medication and/or counselling/therapy. You can check out the following resources for credible information:
 
 * Opens in a new tabKidsHealth
 
 * Opens in a new tabMood Disorders Society of Canada
 
 * Opens in a new tabCanadian Mental Health Association
 
 4. Share resources
 
 You can let your friend know there are ways to get information and support with whatever they're going through, if and/or when they're ready. Here are a few ideas:
 
 * You can visit Kids Help Phone's website to read articles, discover other young people's stories and try tools related to depression and sadness that may help you and your friend cope with the situation.
 
 * You can point your friend to Resources Around Me to search for virtual and in-person services near your community that may help.
 
 * You can also explore Kids Help Phone Insights together, which highlights what young people across Canada are reaching out about. Seeing what other youth are sharing could help your friend feel less alone (if that's something they're dealing with).
 
 5. Connect to support
 
 If your friend would like to reach out for help, you can give them Kids Help Phone's contact information as a starting point. You can offer to contact us with them, or let them connect on their own when they're ready. Our counsellors and crisis responders are available 24/7 and can help your friend sort through their feelings. Your friend could also tell a teacher, psychologist, doctor or other safe adult if they'd like and are able to.
 
 6. Be aware of the signs of suicide
 
 If your friend is talking about dying or experiencing thoughts of suicide, self-injury or death, it's essential to talk to the person and get help from a safe adult right away. You can also read these tips for intervening during a crisis for more information.
 
 7. Take care of yourself
 
 Your mental health and well-being are important, too. If you're really worried about your friend, or just need someone to talk to, you can also contact Kids Help Phone or someone else you trust for support. No matter what your friend is going through, you're being a good friend by checking in on their well-being. But remember, you're not responsible for anyone else's actions, or for making sure your friend gets support. Only they can decide if/when they're ready to take that step.
 
 Where can I find related information?

453,0,"Seasonal affective disorder: What it is & how to cope
 
 Everyone feels sad from time to time, but seasonal affective disorder is something more. Here's what you need to know to cope.
 
 What is seasonal affective disorder?
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and depression are connected. Depression is a common mental disorder that may be diagnosed when a person feels sad, hopeless and low for an extended period of time. Seasonal affective disorder may be diagnosed when a person experiences depression that is seasonal. That is, the feeling comes and goes depending on the time of year. Seasonal affective disorder is linked to weather, daylight and temperature and is more common in winter months. Like other mental disorders, only a doctor or psychologist can diagnose depression and seasonal affective disorder.
 
 What are the signs of seasonal affective disorder?
 
 In addition to the symptoms of depression, signs of seasonal affective disorder may include:
 
 * feeling tired
 
 * sleeping a lot
 
 * craving carbohydrates (bread, potatoes, pasta, etc.)
 
 * weight gain
 
 People who experience seasonal affective disorder may also notice changes in their mood. These changes are often related to the weather, amount of daylight and temperature. Short, dark and cold days (usually in the winter months) may lead to a lower mood. Long, bright and warm days (usually in the summer months) may lead to a more elevated mood. Some people who experience seasonal affective disorder feel like they're a ""different person"" when the weather changes.
 
 What causes seasonal affective disorder?
 
 There is no known, exact cause of seasonal affective disorder. However, it's more common in places far from the Earth's equator (where it's generally hot and sunny). Locations, like Canada, that are farther from the equator often have greater seasonal changes. These changes may lead to shifts in mood.
 
 Similar to depression, seasonal affective disorder can also be genetic. If someone in your family has experienced it, you may be more likely to experience it, too.
 
 How is seasonal affective disorder treated?
 
 Like depression, seasonal affective disorder is treatable. It's important to talk to your doctor or psychologist if you think you may be experiencing it. Here are some things your doctor or psychologist may suggest:
 
 * Light therapy: light therapy uses a phototherapy light designed to mimic the sun. It tricks your brain into thinking you've been exposed to sunlight (like in the summer months). Sit near the light (while watching TV, doing homework, etc.) for 30-60 minutes per day to feel the effects. There are different types of lights, so shop around for one that works best for you. Phototherapy lights are available to use for free in some public libraries or can be purchased from retail stores.
 
 * Antidepressant medication: antidepressant medication lifts your mood. It's important to take the medication exactly as prescribed. Tell your doctor right away if you stop taking the medication, start experiencing side effects or feel worse than before.
 
 * Counselling or therapy: counselling or therapy is a safe place where you can talk to a trained professional. They can help you understand and change the behaviours, thoughts or relationships that are contributing to how you're feeling. Remember, Kids Help Phone counsellors are available 24/7 at 1-800-668-6868 if you need to talk.
 
 How can I cope with seasonal affective disorder?
 
 People with seasonal affective disorder may want to sleep a lot. They may also want to eat foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar. Although these things may make you feel better in the moment, they can actually make you feel worse over time. They also won't make seasonal affective disorder go away. Here are some things you can do to cope:
 
 * go to bed and wake up around the same time every day (even on the weekends)
 
 * try to get eight to 10 hours of sleep every night
 
 * eat a balanced diet (including fruits and vegetables)
 
 * get lots of exercise
 
 * try to spend some time outside during the day
 
 Seasonal affective disorder is a treatable condition, just like depression. Light therapy, proper nutrition and exercise can help you cope. If you think you may be experiencing seasonal affective disorder, it's important to talk to a safe adult.

 Give back:
 
 if you're having a bad day, helping to brighten someone else's day may make you feel better. Do something nice for a friend or volunteer with a local charity.

 Exercise:
 
 go for a walk, dance to music or do some other physical activity you enjoy. This can help boost your mood and make you feel better (mentally and physically).

455,1,"Let it out: How to cope with feeling sad
 
 It's OK to feel sad from time to time. It's important to know what to do if the feeling becomes overwhelming (or if you feel sad all of the time).
 
 Sadness is an important emotion to feel because it can motivate you to do something about a distressing situation.
 
 You may feel sad for many reasons, like:
 
 * you've been disappointed
 
 * you've been rejected
 
 * you've been ignored
 
 * you've been misunderstood
 
 * you haven't achieved your goals
 
 * you lose something important to you (a loved one, your self-confidence, etc.)
 
 You can experience sadness in both your mind and your body. When you feel sad, you may notice:
 
 * pain behind your eyes
 
 * a lump feeling in your throat
 
 * an aching feeling in your chest
 
 * you cry or feel like crying
 
 * you want to be alone
 
 * you want to curl up into a ball
 
 * you feel small
 
 Remember, it's OK to be sad sometimes. There are some ways you can help yourself be OK with feelings of sadness:
 
 * It's OK to let it out: cry, yell, sob... whatever helps you to vent those feelings.
 
 * Breathing helps: focus on your breathing to help your body calm down.
 
 * You'll feel better soon: when you let yourself feel sad, you may feel better more quickly than when you try to stop your feelings.
 
 * You can take a break: if feeling sad starts to be too much, try doing something else for a while, such as writing, sports or hanging out with friends.
 
 It's important to be kind, gentle and patient with yourself if you're feeling really low or vulnerable. Try to give yourself time to recover.
 
 What makes you sad?
 
 It may be helpful to identify things that make you feel sad. You can:
 
 * write down a list of things and situations that make you feel sad
 
 * write down a list of cues your body gives you to let you know when you're getting sad
 
 * write down a list of thoughts, images and feelings that come to mind when you feel sad
 
 How do you deal with sadness?
 
 When people feel sad, they often want to withdraw to give themselves time to recover. You may want to spend some time alone doing something you find soothing such as:
 
 * holding a pillow or stuffed animal
 
 * listening to soft, calming music
 
 * spending time with a pet
 
 * picturing the face of someone warm and caring (imagine hearing that person's voice)
 
 Another way of coping with sadness is to reach out for support. You can try talking to a friend or family member about your feelings. You can also call a Kids Help Phone counsellor at 1-800-668-6868. Reaching out can help you remember you don't have to go through this experience alone.
 
 While spending some time alone can be healthy, too much time alone can make you feel even worse. If you're withdrawing to the point where you're spending a lot of time alone, it could be a sign of depression, and it may be time to reach out for help. Kids Help Phone counsellors are available 24/7 at 1-800-668-6868 if you need to talk.
 
 How to express sadness
 
 Expressing your sadness in healthy ways can be a good way to deal with how you're feeling. Here are a few ways to express your sadness:
 
 * Let it out: vocalize your feelings (cry, yell, scream, etc.)
 
 * Get creative: draw, paint or sculpt
 
 * Let loose: listen to music that reflects your sadness and dance to it
 
 * Put it in writing: write about your feelings in a journal or keep a sadness diary
 
 * Share: talk about your feelings with someone you trust
 
 What's the difference between sadness and depression?
 
 If you're sad, you may just feel a little blue, or you may feel so low that you find it hard to get out of bed or talk to other people. Sadness is an emotion that usually comes and goes and gets better over time. Depression is a mental disorder that's deeper and longer-lasting.
 
 If you think you may have depression, or if you're having trouble telling the difference between sadness and depression, you can read about depression and see if it makes sense. You can also call Kids Help Phone - a counsellor can help you talk through if what you're feeling is sadness or something more.
 
 Sometimes, sadness can feel overwhelming, especially if you try to deal with it alone. It's a good idea to get support if you're feeling sad and talk to someone you trust.

456,0,"Am I experiencing depression?
 
 Although it's normal to feel sad or upset from time to time, depression is deeper and longer lasting. It can affect how you think, feel and act.
 
 Depression is a common mental disorder that can cause people to experience low mood for an extended period of time. It can affect people of all ages and impact all areas of a person's life, including school, your relationships and your physical health. Depression has different types and can only be diagnosed by a psychologist, psychiatrist or doctor.
 
 Experiencing depression doesn't mean you're lazy or weak. It's as real and as serious as a physical condition. Taking care of your mental and emotional health is just as important as taking care of your body.
 
 What are the symptoms of depression?
 
 Everyone experiences depression differently, but certain feelings and behaviours are common, including:
 
 * feeling sad, down or low most days
 
 * feeling irritable or angry
 
 * feeling helpless or hopeless
 
 * feeling anxious, nervous or restless
 
 * crying a lot
 
 * feeling guilty
 
 * feeling like you're alone
 
 * having negative thoughts or feelings about yourself
 
 * having trouble sleeping, sleeping all of the time or feeling tired all of the time
 
 * having trouble concentrating at school/work
 
 * losing interest in things you enjoy
 
 * having difficulty making decisions
 
 * withdrawing from friends and family
 
 * having changes in appetite (e.g. eating less, eating more, etc.)
 
 * taking more risks than you used to
 
 * acting aggressively or disruptively
 
 * using drugs or alcohol to cope
 
 * having thoughts about death or suicide
 
 Only a psychologist, psychiatrist or doctor can make a diagnosis of depression. It's important to talk to a safe adult (e.g. a doctor/nurse, parent/caregiver, counsellor, etc.) if you notice new and ongoing changes in your mood, thoughts and/or actions.
 
 What causes depression?
 
 Many factors can contribute to depression, including experiencing racism and other forms of oppression, trauma, abuse, physical health issues, substance use and more. People may experience depression after a major change in their lives, such as:
 
 * the divorce of parents/caregivers
 
 * a breakup
 
 * conflicts at home
 
 * the death of someone close
 
 * a big move
 
 And sometimes, depression just happens for no clear reason. A combination of physical, psychological and environmental factors play a role in how you feel. Depression can also be genetic, which means that if someone in your family has experienced depression (e.g. a parent), you are more likely to experience it, too.
 
 How is depression treated?
 
 Depression is treatable. It doesn't usually go away by itself, so getting support from a safe adult is the first step to addressing it. The two main treatments for depression are medication and/or counselling/therapy. Here are some things to know:
 
 * Antidepressant medication can lift your mood and help you think more clearly. If a psychiatrist/doctor gives you medication, it's important to take it exactly as prescribed. You can book follow-up appointments with your psychiatrist/doctor to ensure the medication is right for you.
 
 * Counselling or therapy is a safe place where you can talk about what's going on for you with a trained professional (e.g. a psychiatrist, psychologist, counsellor, etc.). They can help you understand and deal with the factors that may be contributing to your mood.
 
 In addition to medication and/or counselling/therapy, it's good to know there are some other things you can try to boost your mood, including:
 
 * exercising regularly
 
 * going to bed and getting up at the same time every day
 
 * eating healthy foods
 
 * practising self-care
 
 * doing breathing exercises
 
 What are some other things to know about depression?
 
 If you're struggling with depression or low mood, there are people and places here to support you. Here are some other things to remember:
 
 * Your mental health is just as important as your physical health. It's about taking care of your overall well-being.
 
 * Depression is common, and no one has to go through it alone.
 
 * Depression is treatable, even if it takes some time to feel better. It's always OK to ask for help.
 
 * If you're experiencing thoughts of suicide, self-injury or death, it's essential to talk to a safe adult for help right away.
 
 * You can search for counselling and mental health support services using Resources Around Me.

 Kids Help Phone is here for you during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you're struggling with loneliness or isolation while practising physical distancing, it's important to remember there are still ways to connect for support.
 
 Loneliness and isolation are feelings you may experience if you feel disconnected from yourself and the people around you.
 
 It's common to feel lonely, isolated and disconnected sometimes, but it can become unhealthy if the feelings last.
 
 If you're experiencing loneliness and isolation, you may feel:
 
 * unloved
 
 * like you don't fit in
 
 * excluded from a group (e.g. your peers, family or society)
 
 * like you don't have any friends
 
 * like everyone else is in a relationship
 
 * like you can't adjust to a new environment (e.g. a move, a new school, staying inside during the COVID-19 pandemic, etc.)
 
 * distant from friends and family
 
 * out of touch with others or society
 
 * like you have no choice other than to be alone
 
 When you experience these feelings for a long time, they may lead to things such as illness, depression or even thoughts of suicide. It's important to talk to someone about how you're feeling. You can try speaking to a safe adult such as a parent/caregiver, doctor, teacher, school counsellor or family member. Kids Help Phone counsellors are also available 24/7 at 1-800-668-6868.
 
 How can I feel better?
 
 If you're feeling lonely or isolated, here's some things to keep in mind:
 
 * Remember you're not alone: almost everyone feels lonely from time to time - lots of people feel the same way you're feeling right now.
 
 * Your feelings are valid: It's OK to feel lonely sometimes. But remember, if and when you need it, help is always available.
 
 * Learn to forgive: if anger and resentment are keeping you from pursuing something that was once important to you, try to make amends.
 
 * Talk to a safe adult: if problems from the past are keeping you isolated, try talking to a parent/caregiver, teacher or doctor about your feelings.
 
 Here are a few things that may help with feelings of loneliness and isolation:
 
 * join a virtual group, club or team
 
 * learn a new hobby or pastime
 
 * invest in the friendships you may already have
 
 * go for a walk or get some exercise (while practising physical distancing)
 
 * get involved in online classroom discussions and conversations (if available)
 
 * try meeting new people online (while practising online safety)
 
 * volunteer virtually for a cause you're passionate about
 
 It's possible to overcome loneliness and isolation, but it may take some time and effort. You may have to try something new - or even a few things - before your feelings begin to change.

458,0,"How to help a friend dealing with grief
 
 Grieving takes time. Grief changes people, especially when it comes to the death of loved ones. That doesn't mean that you will lose your friend. Be patient while they try to figure out how to deal with their loss.
 
 It's common for people who are grieving to feel that they are all alone and that no one understands what they're going through. Their feelings may change from day to day and they may feel confused or have a hard time describing their emotions.
 
 Your friend may show their grief by:
 
 * crying
 
 * worrying about dying
 
 * having difficulty focusing
 
 * not paying attention to you or anything else
 
 * yelling or acting angry
 
 What you can do to help
 
 * Just be there: you don't have to do much to show that you care. Try sitting with your friend while they cry or listening to what they have to say. Don't worry about saying the ""right"" thing or making them feel better.
 
 * Check in with them: ask how they're doing or ask if they need anything. Tell them that you're there for them if they want to talk. Don't tell them to get over it.
 
 * Get your friend out of the house: help your friend to think about something else for a while. Don't be afraid to suggest having some fun.
 
 * Don't avoid the subject: ask how your friend is doing on important days like birthdays, holidays and the anniversary of the loss.
 
 * Help your friend: if they feel overwhelmed, offer to do harder tasks together like studying or chores around the house.
 
 * Mark the memory: offer to help your friend mark their memories in some way, such as planting a tree or making a memory box or collage together.
 
 What to say to a grieving friend
 
 Speak from the heart. There may not be much to say except, ""I'm so sorry."" Here are some other comforting words:
 
 * ""I'm here if you want to talk.""
 
 * ""It's OK to cry in front of me.""
 
 * ""Is there anything I can do?""    
 
 * ""Do you want to take a walk and talk about it?""
 
 * ""I'm so sorry you're hurting.""
 
 * ""How are you feeling?""
 
 If you go to the funeral, it's OK to simply hug your friend if you don't know what to say. Actions speak louder than words and just being there will mean a lot to your friend.
 
 What to avoid when helping a grieving friend
 
 Here are some things that you should be mindful of avoiding while your friend is grieving:
 
 * saying things like, ""You have to get over it eventually.""
 
 * telling your friend to cheer up
 
 * ignoring or avoiding your friend
 
 * smothering your friend by calling, texting or emailing all of the time
 
 * taking it personally

459,1,"Living with loss: Ways to help you grieve a death
 
 Everyone deals with grief differently. You can use these healing rituals to help you grieve a death.
 
 Healing rituals
 
 A ritual is not intended to put the loss away or to ""get over it,"" but to do something meaningful to help you feel better. Rituals can be a healthy way to remember someone you loved and lost. Some different healing rituals include:
 
 * Memory box: gather up ticket stubs, photos and other mementos that remind you of the person you lost. Try writing a letter to that person and add it to the box. Open the box to help remind you of all the great times you shared and the joy they brought to your life.
 
 * Collage: collect your favourite photos of the person you lost and add them to a poster board or online photo album. If you don't have a lot of pictures, try asking family members, friends or other people who knew the person you lost and make the collage or album together
 
 * Healing circle: ask a group of people who knew the person you lost to sit in a circle and talk about your grief. Share your favourite memories. Talk about the things you miss doing with that person. Knowing that you're not alone in your grief may help everyone.
 
 Journaling
 
 Writing can be a great way to explore your feelings, especially if you're experiencing a lot of different things at once. Some sentences that may help you get started are:
 
 * The funniest thing you ever said to me was...
 
 * The last movie we saw together was...
 
 * Your favourite colour/smell/song was...
 
 * We had a lot in common like...
 
 * Things we didn't have in common were...
 
 * I learned from you that...
 
 * I think you learned from me that...
 
 * The saddest thing about losing you is...
 
 * The thing I miss most about you is...
 
 * The last time I saw you...
 
 * The nicest thing you ever did for me was...
 
 * The hardest we ever laughed was...
 
 Prayer
 
 For some people, prayer can be healing after experiencing a loss. If prayer isn't something you believe in, there are other ways of being spiritual that may work for you like meditation, spending time in nature or sitting in quiet reflection.
 
 Funerals
 
 A funeral is a formal gathering of friends and family that usually happens a few days after someone has died. What happens in a funeral depends on the cultural and religious traditions of the family, but all funerals are a way of remembering the person who has died and marking their passing.
 
 Funerals allow friends and family to share their memories and feelings in a safe and supportive environment. Funerals can be sad occasions, but it's OK to laugh and smile, especially over a fond memory.
 
 Losing a pet
 
 Losing a dog, cat or other pet can hurt just as much as losing a person. Some ideas for how you can deal with your grief are:
 
 * have a pet memorial
 
 * make a photo collage
 
 * write a poem about your pet
 
 * keep the tags from your pet's collar and put them on your key chain
 
 * talk to someone you trust. You can always call Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868.
 
 Living with the loss
 
 The loss you're experiencing now may change you. You may never get over the loss completely, but eventually, you will start to feel better. Take your time and be patient with yourself. Some days will be rough, but grief will get better over time. That doesn't mean you'll stop thinking about the person you lost, but you can learn how to cope with your grief so it doesn't consume your whole life.
 
 Take care of yourself
 
 When you're grieving, it can be tempting to numb your pain in unhealthy ways. Healthy ways to take care of yourself include:
 
 * eating nutritious foods and not skipping meals
 
 * getting enough sleep at night
 
 * getting enough exercise
 
 * sticking to a routine
 
 * spending time with friends
 
 Getting help
 
 Remember you are not alone. Try not to shut out the people who care about you, even if they don't understand. Spend time with others who are experiencing the loss. Hang out with friends who can help you think about something else for a while.
 
 If you feel trapped or stuck in your grief, be aware of the signs of depression.

460,1,"Grief and loss: What to expect at a funeral
 
 Attending a funeral can help you grieve the death of a loved one. Here's what you can expect during the service.
 
 Losing a loved one is never easy. After the death of someone close to you, you'll likely experience feelings of grief and loss. People deal with these feelings in different ways and may use healing rituals to cope with their grief.
 
 One ritual people often turn to is a funeral. A funeral is a formal gathering of friends and family held to remember a person who has died. What occurs at the funeral depends on the cultural practices, religious beliefs and wishes of the person who has died and their family.
 
 A funeral may include:
 
 * a visitation or wake (set hours to view the body and visit the family)
 
 * a celebration of life or memorial service (a more casual gathering to commemorate the person who has died)
 
 * a burial (the casket/coffin is placed in an underground grave at a cemetery)
 
 * a procession or parade (attendees drive or walk to where the body will be laid to rest)
 
 * an entombment (the body is placed in an above-ground grave such as a tomb)
 
 * another death ritual
 
 The funeral usually happens soon after the death and may take place over one or several days.
 
 Here are some things to expect and keep in mind about funerals:
 
 * You may notice and/or feel a range of emotions: everyone experiences loss differently and may show their grief in diverse ways. They may cry, laugh, smile or stay silent or expressionless. You may also notice people showing emotions they don't usually (e.g. you may see an adult in your life cry for the first time at a funeral). There is no right reaction to the death of a loved one. It's important to express whatever you're thinking and feeling, in a way that is comfortable for you.
 
 * You may see the body of the person who has died: depending on the family's beliefs, you may or may not see the body at the funeral. Sometimes, there is an open casket/coffin where you're able to view and/or touch the body. The body may look different than you remember (they may be wearing makeup, have their eyes closed, have a blank expression, etc.). Other times, there will be a closed casket/coffin, a photograph/slideshow of the person who has died or no representation of the body at all. If the body was cremated (transformed into ashes), you may see an urn (a sealed container for the ashes). Before the funeral, you can ask someone involved in the proceedings (a friend, family member, etc.) what to expect to prepare yourself.
 
 * There may be people offering their condolences: condolences are when people say things like, ""I'm sorry for your loss"" or other kind words to show their sympathy. It's OK to say, ""Thank you"" or say nothing at all. Other people may try to shake your hand or give you a hug. You only need to do what you're comfortable with.
 
 * You may be able to participate in the funeral: some funerals include speeches, songs, poems, eulogies (a tribute to the person who has died) or other readings. It's OK for you to ask to say a few words, just listen or to leave the room if you need to. You may be asked to be a pallbearer (a person who helps carry the casket/coffin), walk with certain people in and out of the service, greet other attendees, join in prayer, sit/stand in a specific place or contribute in another way. It's OK to ask questions about your role in the funeral or to say ""no"" to anything you're not comfortable doing.
 
 * Some funerals are more extensive than others: some funerals are very formal with official proceedings, while others are more casual. Some funerals may have a lot of people from the community in attendance, while others only have close family members and friends. You may be interacting with people you know or meeting some individuals for the first time.
 
 * Funerals take place at different times or in different places: depending on the type of funeral, the proceedings may take place at different times of the day. Based on the family's beliefs, the service may happen at a place of worship, funeral home, mausoleum/tomb, burial site or somewhere else. The funeral may also include a reception or party afterward. If you're unsure of where to go, what to do/say or what to wear, you can ask a friend or family member for more information.
 
 * Some funerals contain more traditional/religious practices: people attending the funeral may be wearing traditional dress or clothing of the same colour. Religious ceremonies or other activities may also occur during the proceedings. You may see people (e.g. religious leaders) lighting candles, scattering ashes, saying prayers, giving blessings, offering flowers/gifts or doing other things.
 
 * It's OK to ask for support: before, during or after the funeral, it's important to get help if you need it. You can talk to a friend, relative or other safe adult about what you're going through. (There's a chance they may be feeling the same way you are.) You may find it helpful to bring someone else (e.g. a friend who isn't directly impacted by the death) to the funeral for support. You can always contact a Kids Help Phone counsellor (even in private during the funeral) at 1-800-668-6868.
 
 A funeral is a healing ritual that may help you cope with grief and loss. It's good to know what to expect at a funeral and remember that you only have to say and do what you're comfortable with.

461,1,"Coping with grief, loss and change
 
 Grief is the feeling people experience after they've suffered a loss. Everyone experiences grief and loss differently, and the process of healing and moving on will be different for each person.
 
 Grief refers to the feelings that people experience when they have suffered a major loss such as a death. It's how people respond to loss emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually. You may not feel bad all of the time and you don't have to force any feelings that don't come naturally to you. Be patient with yourself and remember that you will get through this.
 
 Grieving a death
 
 Losing someone you love is an incredibly emotional experience. Your body, mind and soul need to adjust to the reality of the loss. Your body, mind and soul are starting to acknowledge the reality of what happened.
 
 Emotional reactions
 
 You may experience a lot of different emotions including:
 
 1. Anger
 
 It's OK to feel angry when someone dies. It's also OK to let it out. Holding your anger in can be bad for you. Here are some healthy ways to express anger:
 
 * play sports
 
 * write in a journal
 
 * listen to loud music
 
 Anger is natural, but if you think you're having trouble dealing with your anger, try reaching out to a safe adult. Contact Kids Help Phone if you need to talk.
 
 2. Confusion
 
 It's normal to feel confused about your emotions after experiencing a loss. You're probably feeling a lot of things that you don't recognize, especially if you've never experienced a loss like this before.
 
 3. Relief
 
 In some situations, relief is a normal response to death (especially if someone was really sick for a long time). Relief can come from knowing that the person isn't suffering anymore.
 
 4. Guilt
 
 You may feel guilty about not telling the person who died how much you cared about them or worry about other things that were left unsaid. Sometimes you may feel guilty for being alive or think that there was something you could have done to prevent the death, even though this isn't true.
 
 Physical reactions
 
 You may experience physical sensations while grieving, like:
 
 * nausea or feeling sick to your stomach
 
 * a tight feeling in your chest
 
 * crying a lot
 
 * a choking sensation or feeling like you can't breathe
 
 * headaches
 
 * exhaustion (like all you want to do is sleep)
 
 * feeling tense and unable to relax
 
 Mental reactions
 
 You may find yourself feeling:
 
 * forgetful
 
 * disorganized
 
 * distracted
 
 * worried about death and the safety of others
 
 Spiritual reactions
 
 After a loss, you may question your spirituality by:
 
 * feeling like your faith isn't enough
 
 * blaming a higher power for allowing this to happen
 
 * thinking your life doesn't have meaning anymore
 
 Different kinds of loss
 
 Death is one of the ways that you can lose someone, but you can also experience grief over other major life changes.
 
 Some of the ways that you can experience loss are:
 
 * breaking up
 
 * moving away
 
 * divorce of family members
 
 * fighting with friends
 
 * losing your spirituality or dreams that are really important to you
 
 * life-changing or life-threatening illness
 
 * developing a disability
 
 Self-medicating
 
 When you're suffering, you may feel like doing anything you can to feel better, even if it's just for a few minutes. This can leave you vulnerable to unhealthy ways of coping, like using drugs and alcohol or overeating. Try to remember that this won't make your problems go away. In fact, it may make them even worse. Take care of yourself.
 
 Don't judge yourself
 
 Remember, all of your feelings are valid and can change from day to day. People deal with grief in different ways. Some people cry a lot while others feel too numb to cry. No one has to know what you're feeling unless you want to share.

 ? self-esteem
 
 Self-esteem is the way a person feels about themselves and how much they value or appreciate their own worth.
 
 Someone with a healthy self-esteem can feel good about themselves and take pride in what they do, their skills and their accomplishments.
 
 Self-esteem is the result of comparing who you want to be and who you are. When you feel good about yourself, you're more likely to:
 
 * pursue and attain your goals
 
 * believe that you are capable of learning something new such as a sport or skill
 
 * try new things
 
 * become more approachable
 
 Will my self-esteem change?
 
 Everyone's sense of self will grow and change - especially when you're trying to figure out who you want to be or how you fit in. Your self-esteem can be shaped by things such as:
 
 * your environment (e.g. you receive constant criticism from your peers)
 
 * how you feel about yourself (e.g. your body image)
 
 * your expectations of yourself (e.g. you downplay your successes and focus on faults and failures)
 
 * your experiences (e.g. you struggle with a difficult life event or family relationships)
 
 I'm feeling low - what can I do?
 
 It's important to know that self-esteem can change for the better. It can grow through things such as achieved goals, finished projects and other feelings of competence and personal pride. When it's strong, self-esteem can help you get through a challenging time. To help your self-esteem, you can:
 
 * remember that you are more than your appearance
 
 * identify your strengths/abilities and build on them
 
 * take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating right and staying active
 
 * counter any self-critical thoughts with positive thoughts
 
 * set realistic goals and plan an approach to stick with it until you succeed
 
 * be generous with others by volunteering
 
 * build a support system of people including family and friends

 ""About seven per cent of people over the age of 65 show some symptoms of depression. Around two per cent experience moderate or severe depression and around five per cent experience mild depression. The moderate or severe forms are much more common among elderly people living in care homes (eight per cent), or those who have dementia (10 per cent). Depression in people over 65 seems to be less common than it is in younger groups.""
 
 (Source: BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information, 2013)
 
 Depression is a serious illness, especially for seniors. Seniors who have recently been moved to a care home or hospital, spend a lot of time alone, are experiencing health problems, or have recently lost a loved one may be at increased risk of depression.
 
 The earlier it is detected, the easier it can be to treat. The most important thing to remember is that depression is treatable. If you are exhibiting symptoms of depression, book an appointment with your physician immediately.
 
 Symptoms of depression
 
 Here are some of the symptoms of depression:
 
 * 
 
 Feeling unhappy most of the time
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Worrying a lot or feel anxious or panicky
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Getting restless and irritable
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Feeling life is pointless and not worth living
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Getting lonely or bored
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Crying a lot for no apparent reason
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Not caring how you look
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Sleeping too much or two little
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Feeling tired even when you're not doing much
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Finding it a struggle to do simple chores
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Having difficulty remembering things
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Finding it hard to make decisions
 
 * 
 
 *

 * 
 
 Losing confidence in yourself
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Experiencing a loss of appetite or weight
 
 * 
 
 * 
 
 Having thoughts of harming yourself
 
 * 
 
 If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms make an appointment to visit your doctor. Make sure you explain any and all symptoms that you have noticed; often one of the reasons depression goes unnoticed and untreated is because we are worried about telling our doctor exactly how we are feeling. Remember the doctor needs to know all the information in order to properly treat your symptoms.
 
 Consider joining a support group
 
 Consider joining a support group to be around other people who are experiencing similar things. There are support groups for people who experience depression or other types of mood disorder symptoms - reach out for the help of people who will understand and not judge you for how you are feeling.
 
 Consider joining a social club
 
 Consider joining a social club. Depression symptoms can make us feel like we don't want to do anything, even getting out of the house can be hard. Even if you don't feel like it, try to spend time in social environments. Make some new friends or re-connect with old ones. Isolation can make you feel alone with your problems and that no one cares about what you. Make efforts to connect with people.
 
 Consider some form of exercise
 
 Consider some form of exercise. Many seniors' centers offer walking groups and low-impact physical activity and there are many research studies that say exercise should be part of a treatment plan for depression. Before you start any exercise program make sure you see your doctor to find out if the exercise you want to do is safe for you.

 As you can see there are differences between the symptoms of depression and of Alzheimer's disease and mainly the differences are related to memory. While there can be mood changes associated with the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, this type of dementia is more of a cognitive disorder rather than a mood disorder like depression. Memory problems can also be associated with depression however so remember only a medical professional like your doctor can correctly diagnose your symptoms.
 
 Risk Factors for Depression
 
 Some people are more likely to experience depression. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, ""Older women are at a greater risk because women in general are twice as likely as men to become seriously depressed. Biological factors like hormonal changes may make older women more vulnerable. The stresses of maintaining relationships or caring for an ill loved one and children also typically fall more heavily on women, which could contribute to higher rates of depression. Unmarried and widowed individuals as well as those who lack supportive social network also have elevated rates of depression. Conditions such as heart attack, stroke, hip fracture or macular degeneration and procedures such as bypass surgery are known to be associated with the development of depression.""
 
 (Source: National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2013)
 
 Risk Factors for Dementia Diseases like Alzheimer's Disease
 
 According to the Alzheimer Society of BC some people have increased risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. There are some risk factors that one cannot control like age, gender and genetics and there are risk factors one does have some control over. In terms of age, ""In Canada, 1 in 20 people over the age of 65 is affected by Alzheimer's Disease. For people over 85 years, the likelyhood of having dementia increases to approximately 1 in 4 people."" (Alzheimer Society BC, 2013). Women are more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and if it runs in your family you are even more at risk.
 
 There are risk factors that can be controlled and they include having diabetes, heart problems, and brain injuries. Keeping your body as healthy as possible will reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. If you or your loved one is experiencing some of the above symptoms of either depression or Alzheimer's disease, please see your doctor.

 Each year new antidepressant medications are researched and made available to the public for symptom relief. Each person might have their reasons for choosing one medication over another and these decisions can be made with your health care provider.
 
 Some people are concerned about taking psychiatric medications; below are some common concerns people have as well as some information to help you make a choice.
 
 I've tried medication before. It doesn't work for me.
 
 There are many different options when it comes to medication, each individual reacts to them differently. It may be possible that the medication you were on was not right for you. Talk to your doctor about the medication that will be best for you and about any side effects you have experienced in the past.
 
 I don't need medication. I can do this on my own.
 
 There is a possibility you can deal with depression on our own if your depression is mild. If your depression is moderate or severe antidepressants are generally included in the treatment plan because they can help stabilize your mood on a regular basis, even if your depression is comes in cycles or episodes. Without medication, you may eventually feel better, but you are far more likely to experience recurring episodes of depression. For chronic problems with depression, home treatments may not work at all and your mood will continue to decline making you a risk for suicide and increased physical health problems.
 
 I've been taking my antidepressants for two weeks now, and I don't feel any different.
 
 It typically takes four to six weeks until a significant improvement in mood is felt. If you still don't feel any better after that point, you may need to alter the dosage of your medication, or possibly switch medications. Make sure to discuss any changes in mood with your doctor. If after four to six weeks you notice no change, discuss this with your doctor. Ideally you will see your doctor weekly or bi weekly when taking a new medication, that way you and your doctor can keep track of the effect of any medications being taken.
 
 If I take antidepressants, I'll be taking them for the rest of my life.
 
 Most seniors who begin to use antidepressants do not stop treatment; it is true that some individuals may benefit from short-term use of medication, this depends on the severity of your depression. Ask your doctor how long you might expect to be on medication.
 
 Antidepressants cause weight gain.
 
 Weight gain is more frequently a side effect of depression than of antidepressants. Once you are feeling better, you may lose weight you have accumulated while depressed. However, if this is of particular concern to you, discuss with your doctor medications that have no weight-gain side effects.
 
 I won't take mood-altering drugs.
 
 Antidepressants are not addictive and they do not change your personality, desires, or decision-making ability. They work by fixing chemical problems in the brain; much like diabetes medication adjusts improper insulin levels in an individual.
 
 Antidepressants make you suicidal.
 
 While there have been studies that show increased suicidal tendencies arising in the first few weeks of treatment, this side effect is very uncommon. During this period, you should be meeting with your doctor on a weekly or biweekly schedule and be sure to report any suicidal feelings you may have. Don't forget that antidepressants are meant to make you feel better, not worse, and they would not be prescribed to you for any other reason.

 ""Many older adults have symptoms of depression, yet they may not seek help, nor be treated for depression. We know, however, that there is a strong connection between depression and suicide. It is important to recognize the warning signs and reach out to someone who may be considering suicide.""

 Suicide Warning Signs
 
 Acute Signs
 
 Threatening to hurt or kill him/herself, or talking of wanting to hurt or kill him/herself
 
 Looking for ways to kill him/herself by seeking access to firearms, available pills, or other means
 
 Talking or writing about death, dying, or suicide, when these actions are out of the ordinary
 
 Additional Warning Signs
 
 There is a mnemonic, ""Is Path Warm,"" that makes it easier to remember the signs to look for:
 
 Ideation (thinking and talking of death)
 
 Substance Abuse
 
 Purposelessness
 
 Anxiety/Agitation
 
 Trapped (feeling that there is no way out, nowhere to get help, a wish to get away from everything)
 
 Hopelessness/Helplessness
 
 Withdrawal (isolating oneself from those around you)
 
 Anger
 
 Recklessness
 
 Mood Changes
 
 (source: American Association of Suicidology, 2012)
 
 If you suspect that a senior is feeling suicidal there are some things you can do. If you believe there is an immediate danger based on the acute signs shown above, call 9-1-1 right away and do not leave the person alone until help is on the scene.
 
 If you are seeing some of the additional warning signs shown above ask gentle questions about what might be going on for the person.
 
 ask the person if they have a plan
 
 ask the person if they have written any notes to anyone saying goodbye
 
 ask the person if they have the means to carry out their plan (if they want to use a gun do they have access to one? If they want to overdose do they have the medication on hand to do so?)
 
 ask the person whether or not they have tried suicide in the past
 
 Discussing thoughts of suicide
 
 Sometimes we are fearful to 'bring up' things that might put ideas into someone's head, be assured that if someone is talking of suicide they already have thought about it quite a bit. It's important to openly talk about problem solving as an alternative to suicide.
 
 Make sure when you are discussing suicidal feelings that you are supportive and non-judgemental, sometimes seniors can feel like they are 'bothering' you or being troublesome if they speak up. Also remember that stigma around mental illness can make people feel uncomfortable discussing such inner feelings and problems. Reassure the person that you care, that you have plenty of time to talk and that you will help them get help. It is important that you do not promise to keep suicidal thoughts or plans a secret. If the person will only talk to you if you promise to keep it to yourself, do not promise this. If you suspect someone is suicidal and will not speak to you, get help for that person. While the person may be angry with you it is better to lose the relationship than to risk the person taking their life.

482,0,"Coping with Loss
 
 Loss is a part of life that becomes more common as you move out of childhood into your teenage years and adulthood. Losing someone or something important to you is never easy, but it can help to learn more about what loss is, how it can affect you, and how to deal with it in healthy and healing ways.
 
 What is loss?
 
 There are many different kinds of loss that affect people. Death is probably the first kind of loss that comes to mind, but a loss is often experienced when relationships end in other ways, such as divorce, a move, or an illness. In fact, any change can lead to feelings of loss; an older brother or sister going off to college, a parent losing a job, a grandparent moving into a nursing home, or a world event that threatens your feeling of security. Many young people experience their first loss when a pet dies. As a teenager, your friendships and relationships are becoming more and more important, and break-ups and changing friendships can be experienced as loss too.
 
 What does loss feel like?
 
 How a person reacts to loss depends on many things, and it can feel different for everyone. How close was the relationship? Was the loss expected or sudden? If the loss involves a death, was the death from an illness or caused by an accident or act of violence? What impact does your loss have on your day-to-day life or future plans? If you've already experienced a loss, each new loss can sometimes bring up painful feelings and memories.
 
 It's normal for your reaction to loss to change over time. An important part of the healing process is feeling and accepting the emotions that come as a result of the loss. At first you might have a feeling of numbness. You might also experience denial, which means that it doesn't feel like the loss really happened. After you have accepted that the loss is real, it's common to experience all kinds of very powerful feelings such as anger and extreme sadness. It's also common to feel guilt in response to a loss, as if you could have done something to prevent the loss, or you should have been more caring or thoughtful before the loss happened. All of these feelings are normal.
 
 It may take a long time, but you will eventually come to accept the loss. Over time, your feelings will become less intense. Nothing, not even time can change the fact that you've had a loss, but you can get back to your daily routine. No one can say exactly how long it will take, but give yourself time, and you'll start to feel better each day.
 
 Is there any way to avoid the painful feelings?
 
 Painful feelings are always part of loss, but there are some things that can help you get through the experience. One of the most important things to remember is to take care of your health by eating, getting enough rest, and avoiding drugs and alcohol. If possible, try not to make any major decisions until you are feeling better, since you probably aren't thinking as clearly as you usually are. Expressing your feelings through talking, writing, music, art, or some other form of expression is often helpful. It can also help to stick to your usual daily routines. It's important to be patient with yourself. While it's impossible to predict exactly how you'll respond to a loss and how long the feelings will last, in most cases, people are able to adjust to loss and eventually move ahead with their lives.
 
 What can I do to help someone through a loss?
 
 Although it may not sound like much, just ""being there"" is the most important thing you can do to help someone who is coping with loss. It may feel uncomfortable to be around someone who is experiencing something so difficult. You may feel helpless because there's nothing you can do to take away the pain. However, listening to the person's feelings, sharing memories, and helping with everyday things such as preparing meals and doing errands can be extremely helpful. Sometimes people find it helpful to go to counseling or to join support groups for people experiencing similar losses. For someone who has suffered a loss, the presence of friends is an important reminder that the loss is only one part of his or her life, and that they're not all alone.
 
 What if I don't start to feel better?
 
 It's important to get professional help if you feel like you can't cope with the loss on your own.
 
 If you or a friend experiences any of the following, it's time to get professional help:
 
 ? Spending a lot of time alone, instead of with friends and family
 
 ? Having changes in eating or sleeping habits, or lack of interest in normal, daily activities
 
 ? Using drugs and alcohol to numb your feelings
 
 ? Doing risky things that you usually wouldn't do
 
 ? Feeling like you want to harm yourself in any way
 
 Anyone who feels that the pain from a loss is too much to handle should think about talking to a professional such as a school counselor, psychologist, social worker, or clergy person. These people can be helpful if you feel that you are having trouble getting over a loss.
 
 The most important things to remember about coping with loss are:
 
 * Be patient with yourself
 
 * Find healthy ways to let your feelings out
 
 * Let people who are close to you offer their support
 
 * See a counselor if you feel like you could use help getting through your loss
 
 If you're concerned about coping with loss, here's a tip on how to bring it up with your provider: ""I've been feeling down ever since (whatever happened). Is there anything that can help me feel better?""
 
",,
492,1,"Depression
 
 Depression is a psychological condition that affects your feelings, behaviors, and thoughts. You may have feelings of sadness or irritability, a lack of energy, feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness, or unhappy thoughts about yourself or your life. You may even feel that your life is not worth living, or think about hurting yourself. Depression can also affect your physical health: you can have aches and pains all over, or in specific areas such as your stomach. You may have headaches, trouble sleeping, eating, or concentrating, or may not be able to pinpoint what is making you so unhappy.
 
 Who gets depressed?
 
 Depression affects children, teens, and adults of all ages. No one knows the exact number of teens affected by depression, but we do know that it affects a large number of teens, both male and female, from all ethnic and racial backgrounds. Sometimes it happens as a direct result of a stressful or upsetting situation, and sometimes it appears when you would least expect it. It's important to try to understand the difference between feeling sad or ""blue'"" - which are typical feelings experienced by everyone at times - and being what is called ""clinically depressed"".
 
 What are the symptoms of clinical depression?
 
 You may:
 
 ? Feel sad or ""empty"" a lot of the time-these feelings may come and go, but last for at least two weeks.
 
 ? Not feel like doing things you used to enjoy, such as playing sports, hanging out with friends, or studying. It may be harder to have fun than it used to be.
 
 ? Feel irritated a lot of the time (things get on your nerves more easily), or you may get angry or lose your temper more easily.
 
 ? Feel tired or have less energy, or you may be restless and edgy.
 
 ? Notice changes in your eating habits. You may eat more or less than you did before you started feeling depressed.
 
 ? Have changes in your sleep, either sleeping a lot more or a lot less than you used to, and/or having trouble falling asleep or waking up.
 
 ? Find it harder to stay focused and make decisions.
 
 ? Not feel good about yourself or about anything you do.
 
 ? Often feel guilty about things that you do or don't do.
 
 ? Feel that things will never get better.
 
 ? Have thoughts about not wanting to live or about hurting yourself, or you may have tried to hurt yourself.
 
 ? Use drugs or alcohol, or engage in other risky behaviors.
 
 How do I know whether I am depressed or just sad?
 
 It's normal to feel depressed or sad sometimes. However, if you have some or all of the symptoms above most of the time for at least two weeks, you could have depression. If you are depressed, you may or may not notice changes in yourself, but usually people who are close to you will notice a change in you. Likewise, if you are close to someone who is truly depressed, you may notice a big change in that person's behavior or mood.
 
 There are no laboratory tests that can be done to prove that you are depressed, like there are for illnesses such as strep throat or diabetes. However, if you think you may be depressed, it's worth talking with someone about it. A professional who is trained to understand depression, such as your health care provider or a counselor, will be able to ask the right questions to help decide if you are going through a period of sadness or whether you have depression.
 
 What are the effects of depression?
 
 Depression has many different and powerful effects.
 
 Depression can:
 
 * Make it harder to work at a job or in school.
 
 * Make it more difficult to make and keep friends. It can also become more difficult to get along with family members.
 
 * Affect your physical health. For example, you may feel tired or run down all the time.
 
 * Make you feel tempted to turn to drugs, alcohol, or sex as a way to escape from your feelings.
 
 * Make you feel extremely irritable and cause you to act out in ways that can get you into trouble, such as yelling or fighting.
 
 * Cause you to have trouble paying attention, which can lead to car accidents and other mistakes.
 
 * Lead to serious injury and even suicide if not treated.
 
 What causes depression?
 
 No one knows for sure what causes depression. The most important thing to keep in mind is that it's not your fault if you become depressed. Most likely, depression is caused by a combination of things, some of which have to do with the chemicals in your brain and some that have to do with what's happening in your life. Some factors that may put you at risk for depression are:
 
 * Genetics - If other people in your family suffer from depression, you may have similar genes and be more likely to get depressed.
 
 * Family problems - A major loss in your family or conflict among members of your family may cause you to feel depressed.
 
 * Feeling badly about yourself - If you are constantly being put down, abused, or neglected, or if you are having difficulty at school or other activities, you may be more likely to feel depressed.
 
 * Feeling alone - Feeling that you are different from others or that your friends and family don't understand or support you can make you feel depressed. Some examples of people who may feel alone or isolated from others are teens who have just broken up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, teens with medical problems, or teens who have parents or family members going through a difficult time themselves. Teens who identify as LGBTQ+ and who may be struggling with coming out to friends and family members or experiencing bullying or other abusive behaviors as a result of their identity- may be especially susceptible to depression.
 
 These are just a few common examples, but there are many circumstances that can lead to feelings of depression. You may experience many of these things and yet not feel depressed. Or you may not have any of these problems but still feel depressed.
 
 It's important to talk with someone qualified to help you if you suspect that you are depressed. A trusted adult such as a parent/guardian,  teacher, guidance counselor, nurse, health care provider, or clergy person can help you find the right counselor. Your health insurance company keeps lists of mental health providers organized by specialty, so you can ask for a counselor who works with teens. If you ever think that you are going to hurt yourself, it is extremely important to tell someone right away and get help to keep yourself safe: you can always call 911 or go to an emergency room.
 
 What should I do if I'm depressed?
 
 If you think you're depressed, it may help you to tell a friend, but it is also very important to talk with a parent or an adult with whom you feel comfortable. Friends are great to talk to and often very helpful, but for advice about serious issues, especially those involving safety, it's important to also talk with an adult. If you don't feel comfortable telling an adult that you are depressed on your own, you might ask a friend to be with you when you talk with someone, or to help you find someone trustworthy.
 
 Adults you might feel comfortable talking to about being depressed:
 
 * Parent, guardian, or other adult relative
 
 * Teacher or coach
 
 * School counselor
 
 * Health care provider
 
 * Minister, priest, rabbi, or another clergy person
 
 Any of these adults should be able to help you find a treatment provider who works with depressed teens. If you tell one of these people and they are not able to get you help, tell someone else. You know your feelings best! Sometimes even adults may have a hard time accepting that a teen is depressed, or they may not know what to do.
 
 If you are having an unusually hard time coping with something for up to two weeks, it's important to talk with someone. Meeting with a counselor may help you figure out how to cope with what you're experiencing.
 
 What if I'm thinking about hurting myself?
 
 Anyone who has thoughts or feelings about hurting themselves should be taken seriously and should get professional help right away! Suicide is the third leading cause of death in teens and young adults, but it can be prevented with proper intervention and early treatment. It's important to realize how serious it is to have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself. When someone is very depressed, they're not able to think clearly and can become confused or make quick decisions about what to do. If you ever feel this way, please tell a parent, trusted adult or friend or someone else who can get you help RIGHT AWAY. If you're unable to get someone to help you or the adult is unsure what to do, call your local emergency room or 911. You can also call or text the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at:
 
 1-800-273-TALK (8255)
 
 www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org
 
 You must remember that hurting yourself is never the right thing to do, and that there are people who can help you.
 
 What should I do if I think that one of my friends is depressed?
 
 If you think your friend is depressed, you should try to get him or her to tell an adult, such as a parent, school counselor, or health care provider. If your friend will not get help, you should talk to a trusted adult. This is especially important if your friend has told you or another close friend that they don't want to live anymore.
 
 You might worry that your friend will be upset with you if you tell an adult. In fact, they may have asked you not to tell anyone. You must remember though, that it is better for your friend to be angry with you at first for telling someone than to possibly hurt him or herself.
 
 How is depression treated?
 
 There are many different kinds of treatment for depression. Deciding on the right treatment for you depends upon how much trouble you are having, what treatment options are available to you, your family's feelings about how you want to deal with the depression, and the recommendations of your health care provider.
 
 * Counseling or Therapy. Counseling or therapy (sometimes called psychotherapy) can help with depression. It includes talking about your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a confidential setting. This means that the counselor cannot tell anyone what the two of you talk about, unless you or someone else are in danger. Talking with a counselor can help you realize that someone else understands how you feel and that you are not alone. When you talk about your feelings with a counselor, you learn to understand yourself better and find new strategies for managing your symptoms. When you have depression, it is not unusual to see your life in a distorted way. For example, you may think that you are not good enough, that others don't like you, or that you are the cause of bad things that are happening. A counselor can help you learn to look at these situations differently. Meeting with a counselor can also help you find ways to cope with your depression and get a better understanding about things that are happening in your life. Counseling can be done in a few different ways. It can be done with a group of teens together, which is called ""group therapy""; with a teen and his family, which is called ""family therapy""; or alone with a therapist, which is called ""individual therapy."" Sometimes a teen will participate in more than one kind of counseling at a time, or begin with one method and move to another. Remember, your counselor is looking out for your best interests.
 
 * Medication. If your depression is causing significant problems in your life, or if you feel that counseling isn't helping enough, your health care provider may suggest medication. Brain chemicals are responsible for some symptoms of depression. For many people with depression, taking medication helps by changing the levels of those chemicals. Sometimes the person you see for counseling will be able to prescribe medication, such as a doctor, a psychiatrist or a nurse practitioner. Other counselors, such as a clinical social worker or psychologist cannot prescribe medication, but will refer you to a mental health provider who can. If this is the case, you will typically continue counseling sessions with your counselor and see the provider who writes your prescriptions less frequently. There are many different medications that treat depression, and it's important to recognize that sometimes you have to take medication for several weeks before noticing a difference in your symptoms. If you decide to go on medication, it does not mean you will be on it for the rest of your life. Once you have been feeling better for a while, your counselor and your health care provider can talk about lowering the dose or stopping the medication. Remember that even if you are feeling better, you should always talk with your health care provider before making ANY changes with your medicine. You might be concerned about taking medicine for your depression, or you might worry what other people think about it. But many people have found medication to be very helpful. It is very likely that you know and respect someone (such as a teacher, parent doctor or friend) who uses medication for depression, too. Taking medication for depression is just like taking medicine for a physical problem-it is just a way to help yourself get better.
 
 * Day Programs and Hospitals. If you become so depressed that you have trouble with your everyday life, or if you are having thoughts about hurting yourself, you may need more help than regular counseling sessions can give you. In this case, you may enter a day program or a hospital. In a day program, you arrive in the morning and spend the day in counseling, group discussions, and activities with mental health professionals and other patients. In a hospital you receive professional care all day and overnight. Both treatments can be very helpful for teens who are severely depressed. Sometimes these are options when you first feel depressed, or may be offered if you have been very depressed for a while and things have not gotten better. A hospital is a place where you can get a lot of support and where mental health professionals can keep you safe. Hospital programs have scheduled activities to help you understand your emotions and figure out how to manage the problems in your life. Often, your family will be involved in your hospital stay and they will get the help they need as well.
 
 Strategies that may help with depression:
 
 Once you have been diagnosed with depression and you are beginning (or considering) some kind of treatment, it is important to have a variety of strategies to help you cope with everyday life.
 
 1. Talking with a family member or friend about your feelings can often be helpful. Sometimes the people in your life may seem very busy and you might think that your feelings aren't important enough to take up their time, but they are! It's helpful to figure out when your family/friend is most available so that you can ask them to set aside some time to talk with you.
 
 2. Try to keep up with your daily activities, even when you don't feel 100%. Be sure to do at least one thing each day that you enjoy, and include activities in your daily routine that you know help you relax. Staying as close to a routine as possible is especially important if you are depressed.
 
 3. Eating healthy foods and being active can help improve your mood. Try to get some kind of exercise for at least 30 minutes, 3 to 4 times a week. It is also important to keep to a regular sleep schedule.
 
 4. Keeping a journal about your feelings, drawing, and writing poetry are examples of ways you might like to express yourself. Often being able to express your feelings will improve how you feel. Try making a list of strategies that you know work well for you, and keep it somewhere easily accessible.
 
 Are there any services that can help me at school?
 
 Yes. Talk to your teacher(s) or guidance counselor so they can help identify specific services that will help you succeed in school. They can also tell you if you are eligible for services under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This law requires all schools (and workplaces) in the United States to provide accommodations for people living with disabilities, so they can manage their schoolwork and job duties. There is a plan schools can set up called a ""504 plan"" to help make sure you get extra help, such as extra time on tests or assignments, or even a revised schedule so you don't fall behind. There is also something called an Individualized Education Plan or IEP that can help too, depending on some other factors. Be your own advocate and don't be afraid to speak up for what you need! Your teachers will get to know you better and be able to make a personalized plan with you.
 
 What else do I need to know?
 
 Depression is more common than you think and most people who receive treatment for depression get better. Unfortunately, many people who are depressed don't seek help. Some people think that seeking treatment is a sign of weakness. Others are afraid to be seen as ""crazy"" for seeing a counselor or taking medication. Some people feel that their thoughts and feelings aren't important enough to concern others, or are none of anyone else's business. Don't let these beliefs get in your way! Depression is real and with help you CAN get better.
 
 Remember that you are a worthwhile person who deserves to be heard and understood. Making the choice to get help is the first step to overcoming depression and being your best self. If you EVER feel that you might hurt yourself due to feeling depressed, TELL SOMEONE, call 911, or go to the closest emergency room for help.
 
 Sometimes people living with depression may also experience thoughts of suicide, death or self-injury.  If you ever feel this way, please tell a parent, trusted adult or friend, and go to the closest emergency room. You can also reach out to the following helpline:

 There are a number of reasons that may cause you or someone you know to have suicidal thoughts. These can be related to mood, past events, current issues, how you’re coping and how supported and connected you feel. Feelings of hopelessness and thoughts of suicide can be much worse following stressful experiences like a relationship breakup, traumatic life event, grief after the death of a loved one, losing a job or failing a big exam.
 
 You might be thinking that nobody cares about you, that you are a burden, and that things are hopeless.  You might be unable to sleep, eat or enjoy any part of life. You often feel exhausted and unable to think clearly through any other options. It’s important to remember that these thoughts and feelings are temporary and no matter how dark it may seem, things will get better.
 
 What to do if you’re thinking about suicide
 
 Having suicidal thoughts can be scary. You may have never had them before, or perhaps the thoughts have been there for a while and you are not sure what to do. Remember that they are just thoughts; you don't have to act on them. Find ways to stay safe, then you can work out how to get support.

 Self-harm and self-injury
 
 Self-harm is deliberately hurting your body to relieve, control or express distressing emotions.

 Anxiety in older people
 
 The symptoms of anxiety in older people are sometimes not all that obvious as they often develop gradually and, given that we all experience some anxiety at some points in time, it can be hard to know how much is too much. Often older people with anxiety will experience a range of symptoms from the categories below:
 
 Behavioural
 •	Avoiding objects or situations which cause anxiety
 •	Urges to perform certain rituals in a bid to relieve anxiety
 •	Not being assertive (i.e. avoiding eye contact)
 •	Difficulty making decisions
 •	Being startled easily
 
 Feelings
 •	Overwhelmed
 •	Fear (particularly when facing certain objects, situations or events)
 •	Worried about physical symptoms (such as fearing there is an undiagnosed medical
 •	problem)
 •	Dread (such as fearing that something bad is going to happen)
 •	Constantly tense or nervous
 •	Uncontrollable or overwhelming panic
 
 Thoughts
 •	“I’m going crazy.”
 •	“I can’t control myself.”
 •	“I’m about to die.”
 •	“People are judging me.”
 •	Having upsetting dreams or flashbacks of a traumatic event
 •	Finding it hard to stop worrying, unwanted or intrusive thoughts
 
 Physical symptoms
 •	Increased heart rate/ racing heart
 •	Vomiting, nausea or pain in the stomach
 •	Muscle tension and pain
 •	Feeling detached from your physical self or surroundings
 •	Having trouble sleeping
 •	Sweating, shaking
 •	Dizzy, lightheaded or faint
 •	Numbness or tingling
 •	Hot or cold flushes
 •	
 •	Depression in older people
 •	An older person may be depressed if, for more than two weeks, he or she has felt sad, down or miserable most of the time or has lost interest or pleasure in most of his or her usual activities, and similar to anxiety, has experienced several of the signs and symptoms across at least three of the categories below.
 •	It's important to note that everyone experiences some of these symptoms from time to time and it may not necessarily mean that the person is depressed. Equally, not every person who is experiencing depression will have all of these symptoms.
 •	Older people with depression tend to present with more symptoms from the physical category compared to the other categories. So an older person is more likely to present to their GP with various physical complaints and difficulty sleeping rather than complaints of sadness or low mood.
 •	Different language may also be used when older people refer to their depression. Instead of describing 'sadness', for example, they may talk about 'their nerves'.
 
 Behaviours

 •	Difficulty getting motivated in the morning
 •	Behaving out of character
 •	Denial of depressive feelings as a defence mechanism
 
 Thoughts
 •	Indecisiveness
 •	Loss of self-esteem
 •	Persistent suicidal thoughts

 •	Excessive concerns about financial situation
 •	Perceived change of status within the family

 •	Dementia and depression
 •	Depression is thought to affect 1 in 5 people experiencing dementia. 
 •	When dementia and depression occur at the same time it may be difficult to distinguish between them because the signs and symptoms are similar. However, dementia and depression are very different conditions that require different responses and treatment, so a thorough assessment by a health professional is recommended.
 •	In older people, both personal carers (e.g. a partner, family member or friend) and professional carers are a valuable source of information. Both personal and professional carers should be included in healthcare discussions and assessment where possible.

 For some older people, talking about personal matters might not come easily. They may have never really talked about how they feel; it wasn’t the thing to do when they were growing up. Others worry about what will happen as a result of sharing their experiences; they do not want to be seen as a burden and they don’t want to be treated differently. Some also worry that asking for help might be seen as a weakness. 
 
 But the community and its understanding of mental health issues has come a long way.
 
 Talking to an older person
 
 If you’re concerned about an older person experiencing anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, or just not coping, then it is important to take the first step. Begin a conversation; your support and concern may make all the difference. 
 
 Opening up the conversation with an older person about the way they are feeling can be tough. There is some more information available on this site to guide you through as well as some helpful conversation starters.
 
 To further support you, we have produced a fact sheet that can guide you through the conversation and give you tips and strategies.

 Connections matter. Strong ties with family, friends and the community provide us with happiness, security, support and a sense of purpose. Being connected to others is important for our mental and physical wellbeing and can be a protective factor against anxiety and depression.
 
 Loneliness is a feeling of a lack of companionship or quality relationships with other people. As we get older, changes in our personal circumstances and lifestyle can result in us feeling less connected to others and increase the risk of us becoming lonely. However, loneliness is not an inevitable part of getting older - there are lots of things you can do to expand and strengthen your social networks.
 
 If you want to be closer to others in your existing relationships, you can work on improving your communication and emotional connectedness; for example learning new skills to help you talk about the important things in life with loved ones, or even just making more time for regular conversations.
 
 Equally, if you'd like to meet new people and form meaningful friendships there many opportunities to join groups or connect one-to-one with people who share your interests and deeper personal values. Organisations across Australia offer social programs and services specifically for older people, as well as those catering to people of all ages.
 
 Beyond Blue’s Connections matter booklet provides practical and evidence-based suggestions for older people and their families and friends to help them strengthen and maintain their social networks.

 For many people, life really does begin at 60. You’ve got more time for the things you’ve always wanted to do – visit new places, take up hobbies, or see more of friends and family. 
 
 However, some things can seem a bit harder. We start losing people close to us. Friends and family are often far away. Our bodies can slow down a bit, and we might have more health issues to worry about. These changes can increase the risk of anxiety, depression and suicide in older people.

 Having the conversation
 
 Some people find it hard to share what they’re going through with family and friends, for fear of being a burden. You might think mental health is a private subject or that you should ‘put on a brave face’, but the reality is that people can’t help if they don’t know what’s going on. We can help you find the words.
 
 Visit your GP
 
 If you're experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression, talking to your GP is a good first step. As well as providing a diagnosis and discussing treatment options, they can refer you to a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. Make sure you book a longer appointment so you have time to discuss the situation without feeling rushed.
 
 It's best to see your regular GP or someone in the same clinic, so that they have a full picture of your overall health and any other medical conditions.

530,1,"Perinatal depression
 
 Becoming a parent brings a wide range of emotions, ranging from joy and excitement to stress and apprehension. The physical changes you go through can also affect your mood and feelings, and it’s common to experience more ups and downs than usual. But depression is more than just a low mood – it’s a serious condition that affects your physical and mental health.
 
 In many cases, depression during the perinatal period (pregnancy and the year following birth) isn’t recognised and may get worse. This can interfere with your pregnancy or becoming a parent. Depression doesn’t just affect you – it can affect those around you, including your relationships and your baby’s development. 
 
 That’s why it’s important to speak to someone if you’re finding it hard to cope. The sooner you get support, the sooner you can get on with enjoying your family. 
 
 Perinatal, antenatal and postnatal depression – what’s the difference?
 
 You might hear some of these terms used and wonder what they mean. Antenatal depression is when you experience depression during pregnancy, and affects up to one in ten women in Australia. Up to one in six women experience postnatal depression, which develops between one month and up to one year after the birth.
 
 Because depression can start before or during pregnancy and continue after childbirth, we often use perinatal depression to cover the whole period from conception until your baby is 12 months old.
 
 Depression may also return in a following pregnancy or after the birth of another child. 
 
 I had never had a history of depression before. This was a very wanted baby... and I remember it clearly... one day a black curtain descended on me... I could feel it coming down...
 
 Depression or the ‘baby blues’?
 
 Many women experience the ‘baby blues’ between the third and tenth day after giving birth, due to changes in hormone levels following childbirth. You might feel tearful or overwhelmed, but this usually passes within a few days and without any specific care – apart from support and understanding.
 
 All parents go through a period of adjustment as they try to handle the huge changes a new baby brings. Remember that you’re not the only ones trying to figure out how to collapse that new pram or settle a screaming baby – all new parents are in the same boat. Most people will go through a temporary adjustment as they learn the ropes and build confidence in their new role. But if you’re feeling distressed, down, sad or overwhelmed most of the time for two weeks or more, you may be experiencing depression.
 
 If you think your partner or baby would be better off without you, or you are having thoughts of suicide or harming yourself or your baby, seek professional help.
 
 Symptoms of depression 
 
 The symptoms of depression during pregnancy or early parenthood are the same as at any other time in our life, but can be a little harder to identify and deal with when you’re pregnant or have a baby. Some of the changes that come with being a new parent overlap with the symptoms of depression – such as changes in sleeping or appetite – and it can be difficult to tell the difference. 
 
 It’s also a time when everything’s new and challenging – it can be hard to know whether your reactions and emotions are within the 'normal' range when your life with a new baby could be feeling pretty far from 'normal'! 
 
 If you‘ve experienced several of the following symptoms for two weeks or more, it’s time to seek support.
 
 Some common symptoms of depression include:
 •	low mood and/or feeling numb 
 •	feeling inadequate, like a failure, guilty, ashamed, worthless, hopeless, helpless, empty or sad 
 •	often feeling close to tears 
 •	feeling angry, irritable or resentful (e.g. feeling easily irritated by your other children or your partner) 
 •	fear for the baby and/or fear of being alone with the baby or the baby being unsettled 
 •	fear of being alone or going out 
 •	loss of interest in things that you would normally enjoy 
 •	recurring negative thoughts – “I’m a failure”, “I’m doing a bad job”, “My life is terrible”
 •	insomnia (being unable to fall asleep or get back to sleep after night feeds) or excessive (too much) sleep, having nightmares 
 •	appetite changes (not eating or over-eating) 
 •	feeling unmotivated and unable to cope with a daily routine 
 •	withdrawing from social contact and/ or not looking after yourself properly 
 •	having thoughts about harming yourself or your baby, ending your life, or wanting to escape or get away from everything. 
 
 If you’re having these kinds of thoughts, it’s important to seek support.
 
 Am I depressed…or just exhausted? 
 
 Because there’s often overlap between the symptoms of depression and the reality of becoming a new parent, the way you’re feeling about yourself, your life and your family can help you differentiate between the two. 
 
 It’s important to recognise that some aspects of your life as a new parent, such as sleep deprivation and increased stress, are risk factors. And when they hang around long enough, and enough of them build up, can lead to depression.
 
 New parent exhaustion 
 •	You’re still able to maintain a relatively positive view of self and your life, despite being knackered all the time
 •	You’re able to recognise that this level of sleep deprivation is only temporary – things will improve
 •	Once you get to rest, your mood will improve 
 •	You’re able to feel pleasure and get joy from things in your life
 
 Signs you may be experiencing depression
 •	Seeing yourself and your life in a negative way - “I’m a failure”, “I’m doing a bad job”, “My life is terrible”
 •	You feel hopeless, and can’t see how things will ever get better
 •	Even with rest, your thoughts and feelings remain negative
 •	You can’t get joy out of anything – even things you used to like.

 Treatments for depression 
 
 The encouraging news is that there’s a range of health professionals and treatments to help with depression. Your GP or other health professional can develop a treatment plan that’s tailored for your needs, situation and preferences. Suggested treatments are likely to include a combination of emotional and practical support, plus some psychological therapy. If your symptoms are more severe, your health professional may consider a treatment plan that includes these approaches together with medication.

571,1,"Depression and feeling depressed is more than just sadness; it’s a combination of how we think, feel and behave
 
 Different people will experience depression in different ways. It’s a good idea to address depression early before it starts having a bigger impact on your life. 
 
 The word ‘depression’ is often used when people are talking about moments when they’re feeling sad or down. It’s normal to feel down from time to time. Many people feel sad after they have gone through stressful or difficult times. This could be a relationship break-up, trouble with family or friends, changing schools or exam times. Lots of people go through this.
 
 There’s no simple answer for why depression happens. For some people, it can be a mix of events or issues that end up affecting how they feel, think and act. Sometimes there’s no clear reason and that’s OK, too.
 
 The good news is that people experiencing depression can and do get better.

 What are the signs and symptoms?
 
 Depression can be different for everyone, but there are some common signs and symptoms. A person may be experiencing depression if they've experienced some of the following changes for more than two weeks:
 
 Changes to feelings or emotions:
 
 feeling unhappy, numb, empty, moody or irritable/snappy
 
 less interest in things that used to be enjoyable
 
 feeling worthless or guilty a lot of the time
 
 feeling like everything is becoming ‘too hard’.
 
 Changes to thoughts:
 
 negative thoughts about themselves, the world and the future
 
 having a hard time concentrating, making decisions, or remembering things
 
 having thoughts of self harm
 
 having thoughts of death or suicide.
 
 Physical changes:
 
 feeling tired most of the time
 
 low energy and motivation
 
 having trouble sleeping, experiencing changes in sleeping habits or not feeling rested regardless of the amount of sleep
 
 changes in appetite, loss of interest in food or eating too much − leading to weight loss or gain
 
 aches and pains that can’t be explained.
 
 Behaviour changes:
 
 withdrawing from family and friends
 
 not getting things done
 
 difficulty with school, uni, TAFE or work
 
 using more alcohol and/or other drugs
 
 getting into trouble and fights.
 
 Sometimes people with depression experience other mental health issues too - like anxiety, panic disorder or substance use disorders.
 
 Some young people experiment with alcohol and other drugs to help them feel good in the short term. Unfortunately, when the effects have worn off, alcohol and other drugs can leave them feeling much worse in the long term.

 What can I do?
 
 There are lots of things that you can do to improve how you feel and get better at managing tough feelings.
 
 It can feel hard to find the energy or motivation to do these things. Sometimes it might feel like nothing will help. Try starting with one thing you know you can do, then slowly add things in step by step. This can help you feel like you’re making progress.
 
 Take care of yourself
 
 Looking after our minds and bodies can help us with our general mental health and wellbeing. You can:
 
 eat well to improve your mood, energy levels and general health and wellbeing
 
 sleep well to help your brain and body rest
 
 get moving to help you sleep better, manage stress and boost your mood
 
 avoid, or at least limit your use of, alcohol and other drugs. 
 
 Notice your thinking patterns
 
 Being aware of our thoughts and feelings is an important step toward improving how we feel. Taking notes on this can help you to figure out which thoughts make you feel better or worse. A journal like this online workbook can help you to understand this more.
 
 Talk about your thoughts and feelings
 
 It’s a good idea to talk to someone that you trust about your thoughts and feelings. Talking to others can help you feel understood and can also help you see things from a different point of view. You might: 
 
 talk to your family or friends, a teacher or coach, your mob or Elders
 
 get support from online communities or resources, or express thoughts to yourself in a personal journal
 
 connect with others and be part of a group, like a sporting club or religious group, to manage feelings of loneliness.
 
 Get into life
 
 Sometimes it can be difficult to think of enjoyable things when you’re feeling low. It might take some extra effort but try to do something that you used to enjoy, even if you don’t feel like it. These activities don’t have to cost money. This can be very helpful in lifting your mood. Try to notice any changes in how you feel before and after these activities, to see those links for yourself.
 
 Learning new skills, like cooking, can also help boost your confidence and help you feel like you’ve achieved something.
 
 Try some relaxation techniques
 
 Practising relaxation techniques can help you manage stress and can help ground you during the tough times. There are lots of websites and apps that can help you with this and you might want to try our interactive activity on mindfulness.
 
 When should I get help?
 
 For some people, using these tips will be enough to manage their symptoms of depression. But if the depression has been going on for too long without improvement, it’s important to get professional help.
 
 Getting help that's right for you
 
 There are mental health professionals at headspace centres and eheadspace (online and phone support) who can help. If you’re at school, TAFE or uni, you may also be able to access a counselling or student wellbeing service.
 
 An important part of professional support can be talking (psychological) therapy. This can help you learn more about how your depression works and how to address how you feel. In certain instances, your general practitioner (GP) might also suggest antidepressant medications. The GP or service you reach out to will help to recommend an approach that works for you. 
 
 Depression and the link between suicide and self harm
 
 Some young people who experience depression self harm or experience thoughts of suicide. Self harm and thoughts about suicide are often ways of trying to cope with difficult emotions.
 
 If you have thoughts of suicide or self harm it’s really important to talk to someone you trust, such as a family member, friend, an Elder or teacher.
 
 You can also develop a safety plan yourself to help cope with feelings of distress and suicidal thoughts by using the BeyondNow app.",,
576,0,"Why do people have suicidal thoughts?
 
 There are many factors that can contribute to someone experiencing suicidal thoughts. These thoughts can be related to a person’s mood, past or current life circumstances, or as a part of a mental health condition.
 
 Many young people have thoughts of suicide when life seems unbearable and they want to end their pain. Most young people who have suicidal thoughts may not actually want to die, they just can’t imagine another way out of what they are going through.
 
 Person looking out at sea from atop a bench
 
 Suicidal thoughts can happen as part of a metal health condition, like depression, personality disorder or other mood difficulties. Suicidal thoughts can also occur when life circumstances have been difficult and stressful, such as after a major loss – like a relationship breakup or a death of a loved one – unemployment and financial stress, or when someone is feeling isolated and alone.
 
 People thinking about suicide often feel as if they’re a burden to those around them and that things are hopeless. Though it can be challenging to reach out, it is very important that people experiencing suicidal thinking are connected with others and able to share their experiences. 
 
 It’s important to know that young people can and DO get through these times in their lives. In fact, most young people who’ve had thoughts of suicide find a way to work through them.   With effective treatment, social support and time, many who have tried to end, or considered ending their lives can go on to live full, meaningful and productive lives.
 
 If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts, it’s important that you seek support. It takes a lot of courage to reach out, and it can be really hard, but getting help can make a big difference to how quickly you can overcome these thoughts and get back on track with your life.
 
 What are the warning signs?
 
 Suicidal thoughts are more common than you might think. Research suggests that 30% of young people between the ages of 12 and 20 have experienced them.
 
 Suicidal thoughts should always be taken seriously. Sometimes people will say something, such as ‘I feel like a burden to everyone’. Or their current circumstances might indicate that they’re thinking about suicide. Often, people considering suicide are dealing with a combination of mental health difficulties and difficult life events. 
 
 Some other circumstances indicate a much clearer need to access professional support. If these are happening for you or someone you know, it is important to seek support. These include:
 
 if a person has recently been discharged from psychiatric care
 
 if a person has previously attempted suicide or if they use self harm as a way of coping
 
 if a person has recently presented to a hospital emergency department for self harm or suicide
 
 if a person knows someone who is experiencing suicidal thoughts, has attempted to suicide, or has suicided
 
 A note on self harm
 
 What to do if someone you know is thinking about suicide
 
 It’s scary when someone you know is thinking about suicide. If you’re concerned that they might attempt suicide, you need to:
 
 stay with them, or arrange for someone they trust to stay with them, until they can see a healthcare professional
 
 remove access to harmful items, such as dangerous objects, alcohol and other drugs
 
 call triple zero (000), go to a local hospital emergency department or contact a mental healthcare service
 
 contact their parent or guardian as soon as you can to let them know what’s happening.
 
 It is frightening and distressing when someone you care about is considering suicide. It can be hard to imagine how things got this bad. You may worry that you ‘missed something’ and feel responsible or guilty. It’s important to know that you are human, and you cannot protect people or prevent everything, all the time. You are reading this, and that shows you care and want to help.

 How to deal with suicidal thoughts?
 
 It can be frightening to experience suicidal thoughts, particularly if they are frequent or intense. They might be new to you, or perhaps you’ve had them before and you’re not sure what to do. You might be feeling hopeless and alone. If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts, you may feel like nothing will make them go away and it can be hard to imagine a time when you will be feeling better. 
 
 When you are having these thoughts it is most important for you to stay safe. Put off any decision to act on the thoughts. Give yourself some time to get some support and get past this difficult time. Consider getting rid of things that might be used to harm yourself. Don’t be alone when things are very hard. Be around others until the thoughts are less intense.
 
 You do not need to act on thoughts about suicide. These thoughts, like other thoughts, can be challenged. And like other thoughts they will come and go.
 
 It can be hard, but with practice you can learn to change how you react to distressing thoughts, even ones about ending your life. Perhaps you can tell yourself that this time will pass, or that these thoughts are not permanent. Remind yourself that thoughts of suicide are just thoughts, and that you do not need to act on them. You might find other ways to challenge these thoughts, and talking to someone about this can give you new perspectives.   
 
 It can be hard to see another way out when you are hurting – but with support, and at times sheer perseverance, you will begin to see that there are many other ways to move past your pain. Getting support can also help you to work on the things that are contributing to your distress. It can take time to work out what works for you.
 
 Here are four ways to be safe and deal with suicidal thoughts:
 
 1. Ask for support
 
 2. Create a safety plan
 
 3. Get to know what self-care looks like for you
 
 4. Let others know what you’re going through",,
582,0,"We all feel lonely from time to time. Some people feel lonely when they’re surrounded by people, and others are totally OK on their own. Everyone experiences loneliness differently.
 
 For many people, COVID-19 has changed the way they work, study and interact with people. With some of us experiencing greater restrictions, we can feel cut off from the important people in our lives and this can increase our feelings of loneliness. 
 
 The good news is, with the right strategies and support, we can make changes in our lives to address loneliness.  
 
 What is loneliness? 
 
 Loneliness is a feeling and like all feelings, it’s trying to tell us something. Feeling lonely lets us know that we aren’t feeling meaningfully connected enough with other people. It's trying to motivate us to do something different. This doesn’t necessarily mean having lots of people to hang out with, it’s about meaningful connections – feeling understood and supported. 
 
 For some people, loneliness can feel overwhelming and can lead to feeling flat, sad and worried. Some people who experience loneliness might also experience anxiety or depression. 
 
 Loneliness is not always the same as being alone. Some people can have little contact with others and not feel lonely at all. 
 
 When might you feel lonely? 
 
 Feeling lonely can happen at any time. Big life changes such as relationship break-ups, the death of someone close to us, or moving somewhere new can increase the likelihood of us feeling lonely. Other things might include: 
 •	starting new jobs, school or university 
 •	living alone 
 •	not feeling understood by others 
 •	having little contact with others 
 •	not feeling we fit in
 
 It’s not easy to admit that we’re feeling lonely. We might feel ashamed, or embarrassed, or we might think it’s our fault, but it’s really common. 
 
 feeling connected to others helps improve our mental health and wellbeing.

 So what can you do? 
 
 There are many things we can do to support ourselves that can help us connect with others:  
 •	acknowledge that you’re feeling lonely. It’s trying to encourage you to do something new. Understanding our emotions is an important step in trying something different 
 •	notice your unhelpful thoughts. Our thoughts can impact on how we view ourselves, the world and other people. There are things we can do to respond to them in more helpful ways 
 •	create a routine. Include meaningful tasks and enjoyable activities and spend time doing nice things. Doing stuff is really important for our mental health and wellbeing 
 •	be kind to yourself. It’s easy to judge and blame ourselves, give ourselves a hard time and compare ourselves to others. Self-compassion helps gives us the strength to continue when we’re faced with life’s challenges. 
 
 Create connections
 
 Connecting with others is an important part of being human. Healthy relationships support us, give us a sense of belonging and can improve our mental health and wellbeing. 
 
 It can be hard to develop relationships though, and if we’re feeling lonely it can make this seem even more challenging. We might feel awkward or shy, or doubt ourselves and our ability to make friends. But none of us are born with social skills, we learn them along the way. Building skills isn’t always easy, but with practise and patience, we can get better at it.  
 
 Putting ourselves out there can feel scary, but if we want things to change, we need to support ourselves and take action. When we face the things that challenge us, we start to build skills and gain confidence in our ability to cope.  
 
 Being brave increases our chances of finding meaningful connections – often the first step is the hardest part. If we don’t try, then we might never know what’s out there.  
 
 Grow a relationship
 
 Friendships can take time and effort to grow.  Reach out to someone you have something in common with, invite them out and base the activity around whatever you have in common.  
 
 If you’re experiencing restrictions due to COVID-19, you might want to get creative and connect online/via phone.

663,1,"Depression is one of the most common health issues for young people in Australia.
 
 Many young people have occasional mood swings or experience times of irritability. If your young person seems sad or irritable most of the time, and this has gone on for a while and is stopping them from doing things that they used to enjoy, they may be experiencing depression.
 
 What is depression?
 
 Depression is one of the most common health issues for young people in Australia.
 
 Depression is the term used when feelings of sadness, depression and irritability have lasted longer than two weeks, affect most parts of daily life and stop people from taking part in activities that used to be enjoyable.
 
 There is no simple answer for why people develop depression. For most people, it is a combination of events or issues that end up impacting on their feelings, thoughts and behaviours.
 
 What are the signs of depression?
 
 Depression can be different for everyone, but there are some common signs and symptoms.
 
 A young person may be experiencing depression if, for more than two weeks, they've experienced some of the following changes:  
 •	Changes in emotions:
 
 o	appearing down, moody or irritable – for example being short-tempered or more sensitive to criticism than usual
 
 o	tearfulness or frequent crying
 
 o	tiredness, lack of energy and motivation
 
 o	seeming worried or tense.
 •	Changes in thinking:
 
 o	difficulty concentrating and making decisions, or remembering things
 
 o	expressions of worthlessness and guilt, such as being self-critical and self-blaming
 
 o	negative body image and low self-esteem
 
 o	having dark and gloomy thoughts, including thoughts of death or suicide.
 •	Changes in behaviours:
 
 o	no longer engaging in activities they used to enjoy, or doing so with less enthusiasm
 
 o	less attention to personal hygiene and appearance
 
 o	avoidance of peers and family interactions and more time spent alone
 
 o	self harm behaviours.
 •	Physical changes:
 
 o	loss of appetite and weight (but sometimes people 'comfort eat' and put on weight)
 
 o	trouble sleeping or over-sleeping and staying in bed most of the day
 
 o	restlessness, agitation or being ‘slowed down’
 
 o	unexplained aches and pains, such as headaches or stomach pains. 
 
 Many young people experience some of these symptoms in response to stressful life events. What makes the experience of depression different is that the symptoms are more severe, happen more frequently and they tend to persist over time.
 
 Common depression problems
 
 There are two main types of depression that are considered to be disorders:
 
 1.	Major depression – this is the condition that most people are familiar with. Major depression is usually experienced in ‘episodes’, with symptoms of depression building up over a period of a few weeks or more. It involves low mood and loss of interest and enjoyment in usual activities, in addition to other symptoms.  A person experiencing major depression may be unable to complete their school work or go to work and may even have difficulty getting out of bed.
 
 2.	Mild depression (dysthymia) – this is often described as a ‘milder’ version of depression compared to major depression. There are usually less symptoms but they tend to go on for much longer, sometimes for many months. A person experiencing mild depression can often do their daily activities but it takes more effort and it’s less enjoyable.
 
 If you're concerned about a young person
 •	Let them know your concerns: If you suspect a young person may be experiencing a tough time, it is important to let them know that you are aware of the changes you have noticed in them. Let them know that you are concerned and give them the opportunity to talk to you about it.
 •	Listen to them: Take the time to listen to them and to understand their experiences. Check that you have understood them by asking questions.
 •	Offer support: While it can feel tempting to want to ‘fix things’, try not to jump into ‘problem-solving mode’ straight away. Let your young person know that they don't have to go through things on their own and that you are there to help and support them.
 •	Practise patience: If the young person denies there is a problem, try to be patient. Some people need time or space before they feel ready to accept help. Be honest about why you are worried and tell them that you care for them. If they are not ready to talk, let them know you’d like to check in again soon if you're still concerned. Ensure the young person knows you love and care for them and that they can speak to you anytime about how they’re feeling (it’s always helpful to remind people you love them).
 •	Learn more: Learning more about depression will help you to understanding what your young person is going though and how you can help you to support them.
 
 Helping a young person manage their depression
 
 There are some things that you can encourage your young person to do to help manage their experience of depression.
 •	Self-care: It's important to encourage self-care activities like eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep and avoiding alcohol and other drugs.  You could suggest that they try some of our tips to improve how you feel.
 •	Connecting with others: Encourage your young person to maintain contact with other people – such as friends, a teacher or coach. Spending time with their mob or Elders and reconnecting with country can also be helpful.
 •	Participating in activities they enjoy: Encourage your young person to try enjoyable or relaxing activities – this can help boost their mood and help them to feel like they’ve achieved something rewarding.   
 
 Remember, it can feel hard for a young person experiencing anxiety to find the energy or motivation to do these things. Encourage them to start with one thing they know they can do, then slowly add things in step by step. This can help them feel like they’re making good progress.
 
 When should I encourage professional help?
 
 If your young person doesn’t seem to be improving over time, or if things seem to be getting worse, encourage them to seek professional help. You could support them to visit their local doctor or their nearest headspace centre, or contact eheadspace for online and phone support. If they are attending school or university, they may also be able to access a student counselling or wellbeing service.
 
 An important part of professional support is often psychological therapy. This might involve helping the young person to understand their experiences of depression and to change unhelpful thinking and behaviour patterns. Antidepressant medications can also be added if they are needed.
 
 The good news is that most young people experiencing depression respond well to treatment. While some days may not be as good as others, with support your young person can get back to enjoying life again. Remember, getting support and treatment early can make a big difference when dealing with depression, and help to prevent further episodes of depression in future.
 
 Depression – suicide and self harm
 
 Some young people who experience depression may harm themselves or experience suicidal thoughts. For many young people, self harm behaviours and thoughts about suicide are ways of coping with difficult emotions.
 
 If you are concerned that a young person is engaging in self harm or is experiencing suicidal thoughts, encourage them to seek help from a professional. If they have hurt themselves, you take them to a doctor, your local hospital or call 000.
 
 Looking after yourself
 
 Supporting a young person experiencing depression can be challenging. It is important that you take care of yourself, while being a supportive carer.  Being at your best means that you can offer greater patience and a more considered approach as to how you can help others.
 
 Ensure that you take care of your own physical and mental health by getting good sleep, doing regular exercise, having a healthy diet, limiting alcohol consumption and keeping up enjoyable and relaxing activities. Looking after yourself in these ways will also encourage your young person to do the same.
 
 Remember, professional support is available for both you and your young person. For more advice and guidance on how you can best support your young person, visit the websites below or contact eheadspace and talk to one of our family and friends specialists.

 There are a number of reasons why a young person may self-harm. It may be a way of telling other people about their distress and asking for help, a way of coping with stress or emotional pain, or a symptom of a mental illness like depression. Sometimes it suggests that they are thinking about suicide. Not everyone who self-harms is suicidal, but sometimes people die as a result of their self harm behaviour.

665,1,"The grieving process can take time and it’s not unusual for young people to experience ups and downs over months or years while dealing with grief.
 
 It’s normal to experience sadness and to grieve after loss. But that doesn’t make it easy. Some people say grief is the most powerful thing that can be experienced in everyday life. It’s what happens after the loss of someone or something really important to you. Everyone experiences grief differently, so it can be hard to know how a young person might respond to loss. However, there are a lot of ways to support a young person experiencing grief.
 
 Supporting a young person experiencing grief
 
 What to expect?
 
  Grief can affect almost every part of life, and sometimes makes the simplest tasks feel like climbing Mount Everest. Here are some of the things to look out for in someone who has just experienced a significant loss.
 
 FEELING:
 
 Don’t be surprised if the young person you’re supporting has strong and unpredictable mood swings. Grief can include an intense combination of the following: shock, disbelief, pain, intense sadness, longing, guilt (about the past, or about being happy in the future), anger, resentment, abandonment, confusion, anxiety, worry.
 
 THINKING:
 
 It might seem like the person you’re supporting is lost in a world of thought, and more distant than usual. Other ways thoughts can be impacted can include: trouble concentrating or focusing on everyday tasks, increased forgetfulness, a sense that the world doesn’t make sense any more, or that a young person can’t figure out their place in it.
 
 BODY CHANGES:
 
 Changes in a young person to watch out for when supporting someone experiencing grief might include: headaches, stomach aches, body aches, changes in eating and sleeping patterns, weight changes, feeling tired or just generally sick and run down.
 
 DOING:
 
 You might notice the young person you’re supporting spending more time alone, or avoiding certain people or places. Don’t be surprised if they cry a lot, or have more unpredictable outbursts than usual.
 
 It’s important to acknowledge that young people will respond to grief in different ways. Some young people will choose to express their grief through creative expression such as art or music. Others may want to talk about it, and some may appear to be unaffected and getting on with their life.
 
 There will also be some young people who behave in ways that are disruptive, frustrating or risky. Some may turn to using alcohol or use drugs to try to cope with their grief. Whatever their response they will need time, support and understanding as they find their way through their grief.
 
 How long will this go on for?
 
 Most young people will carry on with their lives while moving through the grieving process, and not require professional support. For some however, the loss may contribute to the development of more serious mental health problems.
 
 It’s common for people to be impacted by grief for varied lengths of time, but if there is still ongoing difficulty beyond 6 months in a number of domains as listed above, it’s important to seek professional support.  
 
 Sudden or unexpected loss can be particularly challenging. It can shake assumptions about how the world ‘should’ work in a safe, predictable and just way. If a young person has experienced sudden or unexpected loss, it’s important to consider earlier help seeking. 
 
 What can I do to support someone who is grieving?
 
 Families are extremely important in supporting a young person who is grieving. Continuing your family life and encouraging your young person to stay connected with friends and activities will allow them to maintain a sense of safety and security, and to feel hopeful about the future. Loss can contribute to a sense that things are out of control for a young person. Helping them to regain some control can be important.
 
 It can be particularly challenging for families to support each other when a family member has died, because everyone will grieve in different ways. Professional support might be helpful if you're finding it difficult to support each other through a loss.
 
 Some other strategies that may be helpful in supporting a young person include:
 •	Acknowledging their loss and the need to take time to grieve
 •	Providing information about normal patterns of grief
 •	To talk openly and honestly about the loss and your willingness to support them
 •	Ask them what they might need from you
 •	Be patient. Someone experiencing grief can be unpredictable. Responding to their needs in a way that is calm, consistent and responsive will help them to feel safe and connected with you.
 •	Encouraging their continued participation in enjoyable activities such as sports or hobbies, and family activities
 •	Supporting them as they gather stories and memories of the loved one in ways that appeal to them (e.g. writing, photos, journals, talking, blogs or memorials)
 •	Helping them to anticipate times that may be particularly difficult, (e.g. Christmas, birthdays or anniversaries) and develop a plan for coping with these periods
 •	Helping them find meaning in what has happened and foster a sense of hope for the future
 
 Below we’ve got a brief list of do’s and don’ts that you may find helpful in your efforts to support someone going through grief.
 
 DO:
 •	Try to understand their point of view and their experience
 •	Tell them you might not always get it right but that you’ll always try
 •	Let them know you’re available to support them
 •	Ask what they need from you
 •	Support them to access professional support if it’s getting too hard or scary for you
 •	Ask how they’re feeling
 •	Arrange to do some fun things together. Grief can be a part of them – but certainly not all of them.
 •	Direct them to additional resources and supports as listed below, if you think they need them.
 
 DON’T:
 •	Minimise or trivialise their experience. (For example: “It’s not that bad” or “Come on, toughen up”.)
 •	Ignore or avoid their efforts to talk about this with you
 •	Avoid opportunities where it might come up
 •	Tell them to get over it
 •	Forget that a healthy experience with grief can build significant lifelong abilities and strengths, and can also really build your relationship with them
 •	Forget important anniversaries or dates or events 
 
 Getting help and support
 
 The grieving process can take time and it’s not unusual for young people to experience ups and downs over months or years while dealing with grief. People generally find that things get easier as time passes; however, if the young person’s grief is persistent and severe, getting help is important. Accessing professional support is particularly important if the young person is grieving for someone who has died by suicide.
 
 If you’re also experiencing grief, it is important to check in on yourself, and access support if you need it. Modelling proactive self-care behaviours can have a big impact on how your young person responds to their grief. It might help to think about the standard airline safety brief, where in the case of emergency they ask you to put your oxygen mask on before helping others, to make sure you’re able to be as helpful as possible.
 
 If you would like to provide additional support to a young person, it might help to use this as a guide, depending on their needs.
 
 1) See the additional resources listed below.
 
 2) Find an online or phone-based service you can access anonymously and free of charge (such as eheadspace, Kids Helpline or Lifeline).
 
 3) Check in with your local general practitioner (GP).
 
 4) Find your nearest headspace centre or for online and phone support visit.

794,1,"Common reactions to death
 
 When someone you know dies, it can turn your life upside down. People grieve in many different ways over the death of someone close to them. Find out about common reactions to death and grieving, and what you can do when you’re going through this difficult time.
 
 This can help if:
 •	you’re in shock
 •	someone has died and you’re not sure how to respond
 •	life feels like it’s been turned upside down after someone has died.
 
 Reasons why people react differently to death
 
 Dealing with death, particularly the death of someone you love, is one of the most stressful experiences you can go through. Everyone reacts differently to death, and it’s normal if you feel like you’re riding on a rollercoaster of different emotions. How you react to death can be affected by many things:
 •	The type of relationship you had with the person: The new loss may remind you of earlier losses you’ve had, which you may grieve for again.
 •	Your gender: Guys are sometimes more likely to express their grief through physical activity. Girls are often more likely to want to share their feelings with others, talk about what’s happening or cry more openly.
 •	Your cultural background: Different cultural groups deal with grief in different ways, including how you express your grief through rituals and ceremonies, and different rules around what is considered respectful.
 •	Your age: Younger children may not understand that the person isn’t coming back, or why. When you’re older, you understand that the person is gone forever, but you may still find it difficult to take this fact on board.
 
 Common reactions
 
 The most common reaction on hearing of the death of someone close to you is shock. Shock can affect you for a few days or a number of weeks. When you’re experiencing it, you might feel:
 •	Sick
 •	Dizzy
 •	Nauseous
 •	Dazed
 •	Numb
 •	Empty.
 
 You can also feel some unexpected emotions as a result of shock. It’s completely
 
 normal to react in ways you can’t control, and none of them are wrong. You might:
 •	be in complete disbelief about what has happened
 •	feel nothing initially (a completely normal reaction), before you eventually start to feel various emotions
 •	react strangely – for example, some people laugh.
 
 Grieving
 
 When the shock wears off a bit, you’re likely to start grieving. Whatever your experience, don’t stress about how you’re handling it. Everybody grieves in their own way, including:
 •	Physically: Headaches, feeling tired, achy muscles and nausea.
 •	Emotionally: Sadness, anger, disbelief, despair, guilt and loneliness.
 •	Mentally: Forgetfulness, lack of concentration, confusion and poor memory.
 •	Behaviourally: Changes to sleeping patterns, dreams or nightmares, or to your appetite. You might or might not want to go out or be around people. You may also experience unusual emotional reactions or feel weepy.
 •	Socially: Some friends may avoid you because they don’t know what to say or how to help you. You might also feel pressure to be strong for family or friends, or you may not feel like seeing anyone.
 •	Spiritually: Your beliefs may be challenged and you may struggle to have faith in the things that you once believed in.
 
 You need to look after yourself
 
 You’ve got to take care of yourself when someone has died, as the stress can really affect you physically and emotionally. Take some time out to recover and relax. Find out about some things you can do to help you cope.
 
 If you feel that things are building up, it can help to talk to someone you trust. If you can’t turn to your friends and family, visit your GP or a counsellor. They’ll be able to suggest some things you can do to help you through the grieving process. You don’t have to cope with it alone.

 A few things we’ve learned:
 •	‘Not having friends’ is just one of the many reasons why people might feel lonely. Many young people feel lonely despite having good relationships with friends and family. It’s all about the level of connection you have with the world around you.
 •	The truth is, it’s normal for young people to experience loneliness. It mostly happens for really common reasons like transitions in your life such as those between school, work, and higher education.
 •	Research shows that a lot of young people feel pressure to socialise all the time. This can mean that you might feel uncomfortable when you’re alone, and like you should be doing things with others.
 •	It’s important to try and enjoy your alone time and use it to recharge and reset. This means stop the doomscrolling, and do something that you really enjoy! 
 •	If you do think you need to up your social game, building social skills is just like building any other set of skills. You’ll find it’s a lot easier when you start small and work your way up over time. That’s why ‘micro-interactions’ with people like baristas, classmates or rideshare drivers can be helpful. 
 •	Mindfulness can be a really helpful tool to make us a little less nervous about social interactions. 
 
 Many other people might feel lonely because of life transitions, especially younger people.

797,0,"What is loneliness?
 
 If you're reading this, chances are you know what it’s like to feel lonely. That means you know that loneliness can sometimes feel like it’ll never end, and that you can often be surrounded by friends and family and still feel cut off from the world. But loneliness isn’t something that you have to manage on your own, and though it might be hard, there are things you can do to feel more connected to people around you.
 
 Why do people feel lonely?
 
 Because loneliness is so common, it makes sense that there are also lots and lots of different reasons why people feel lonely. Here are a few of the main ones:
 •	Feeling distant from friends. Ever felt like even though all of your friends are one tap of a button away, you’re still not really connected to them? Don’t worry: this is a very common feeling. 
 •	Being single. Perhaps you’ve recently gone through a breakup, or maybe you’ve never had a romantic relationship. Either way, even though finding a meaningful relationship takes time, for some people, being single makes them feel like they’ll never find love. 
 •	Not fitting in. Maybe you have different interests to the people at your school. Or maybe you just dress differently. In any case, feeling like you don’t fit can make the symptoms of loneliness even worse, and can mean it’s even more difficult to meet friends and feel connected.
 •	Looking after a parent or sibling. Being the primary carer for someone close to you who is sick or has a disability can often make you feel like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders. After all, a lot of your friends won’t know what it’s like to have a brother with Down’s syndrome, or a mother with bipolar, so being a carer can leave you feeling like you can’t really talk to people – let alone have them over for dinner or a sleepover.
 
 How normal is it to feel lonely?
 
 Recent research from ReachOut has shown that one in five young people reported feeling lonely 'most of the time' or 'always'. 
 
 So just because you’re feeling lonely, it doesn’t mean that you are different or ‘weird’: in fact, it means that you have more in common with the people around you than you realise.
 
 Disability, illness, racism and loneliness
 
 Sometimes loneliness can be caused by something else going on in our lives. Here are some of the major issues which can cause loneliness:
 •	Mental illness. A lot of mental illnesses like bipolar, anxiety and depression can all make people feel very lonely. Mental illness can make you anxious about seeing others, so you might spend more time indoors. Or it can lead to insomnia, which in turn can make you tired, irritable and lonely.
 •	Disability. A range of disabilities can often make people feel as though there is no one around them that cares. These feelings can get even worse if people in public are unkind or rude, and facing daily discrimination can make loneliness even harder to bear.
 •	Racism. People who encounter racism say that being discriminated against can make them feel alone, and can make it harder for them to form real connections. Racism takes a lot of forms, all of them hurtful, so sometimes even a ‘minor’ or ‘casual’ act of racism can have big impacts on someone’s self-esteem.
 
 When do people feel lonely?
 
 Loneliness can hit anyone at any time. Sometimes you might not even feel lonely for an obvious reason, and what you’re experiencing could always be connected to other things like depression or anxiety.
 
 But it's true that a lot of people tend to feel lonely during big life events. Maybe you’re moving house. Maybe your parents are getting separated. Maybe you’re going from primary school into high school. Or maybe you just feel like you’ve outgrown your friendship group, or that they’re starting to get into things that don’t really interest you.
 
 All of these things could be making you feel lonely and lost, and you might find it hard to connect with people around you.
 
 How do you manage loneliness?
 
 There’s no one single way to fight loneliness: if there was, everybody would be using it! But that doesn’t mean that loneliness is impossible to beat, or that if you’re feeling it now you will be forever. Here are a few quick dot points that cover some of the ways you can start feeling more at peace with the people in your life:
 •	Talk to people you trust about how you feel.
 •	Think about your interests and hang out with like-minded people (check out your school or local community centre to see if there are any groups you might like). 
 •	Get a pet or try pet minding. 
 •	Get online and play a game or check out our Forums. 
 •	Say yes to any social invitations that might come your way.
 •	Practise dealing with the feeling of loneliness by validating the emotion (e.g. ‘It’s okay I feel this way’, ‘Everyone feels this way sometimes’) and talking to yourself like a friend (‘I’m here for you, this will pass).

 By Anonymous 
 
 To some, the idea of being lonely when you’re in a relationship might seem strange. How can you feel alone when you’re so involved with another person? The truth is, we can feel lonely regardless of who is around us. A few years ago, I was in this exact situation.
 
 What are the signs of loneliness in a relationship?
 
 You might be experiencing loneliness if you’re in a relationship but experiencing feelings of isolation, sadness, and alienation because of your social situation. If the last time you had an amazing time without your partner was a long time ago, you might need more social connections outside your relationship.
 
 My story
 
 My partner and I had been dating for about a year and were deeply in love. However, I began to notice that my previously busy weekends were now spent either with her or by myself. When I’d see photos and videos on social media of my friends hanging out without me, I felt very isolated. I’d still see people now and then, but it felt different from before. At first, it wasn’t clear to me why I felt this way, but eventually I understood and started to try to improve my situation. 
 
 What causes loneliness in a relationship?
 
 The first step is figuring out exactly why you’re feeling isolated in your relationship. Here are the three main causes:
 •	You’re not spending enough time with friends other than your partner.
 •	You’re having communication problems with your partner.
 •	Your partner’s behaviour may be toxic, which might be making it difficult for you to connect with them.
 
 1. Are you spending enough time with your friends?
 
 While you’re settling into a committed relationship, it’s normal to spend a bit less time socialising with your mates, but this can easily result in your losing contact with certain valued old friends. 
 
 Friendships are important, not just for your own wellbeing, but also for the health of your primary relationship. When both people in a relationship have a strong support network, it can take some of the pressure off their partner to be the only source of care, strength and encouragement. 
 
 2. Are you having communication problems?
 
 Even though your partner might be the person you’re closest to, it’s not uncommon to experience loneliness if you don’t feel heard by them, or if it’s hard to have an open and honest conversation with them.  
 
 If you’d like help with working on communication issues, check out some tips for having tricky conversations here.
 
 3. Is your partner’s behaviour hurtful and toxic?
 
 It’s normal in a relationship to sometimes be jealous or a bit ‘clingy’, but this can occasionally spiral out of control into codependent behaviour. Codependency is when a person feels like they desperately need their partner’s love, support and care in order to prop up their sense of self-worth. As a result, codependent behaviour can be quite toxic. A codependent partner may:
 •	insist that you’re responsible for their feelings of anxiety or jealousy
 •	say and do hurtful things because they fear losing you
 •	get worked up every time you see a certain friend or group of friends, or ask that you not see them altogether 
 •	ask you to make unreasonable sacrifices for them
 •	violate your privacy by doing things like looking at your messages or browser history.
 
 Sadly, these were all things that happened to me during my relationship. Even though my partner and I were able to have fun together, the truth is that the relationship was still toxic and I felt very alone a lot of the time. Fortunately, I was able to ease these feelings in a few ways.
 
 Not all toxic behaviour in relationships is abuse, but often emotional abuse begins with behaviours like these and escalates over time. If you’d like to know more about what emotional abuse is and what can be done about it, read our article about it here.
 
 Three things that have helped me and others
 
 1. Knowing that your friends are still there if you need them
 
 I was afraid that my friends had begun to forget about me, or that they resented that I was spending less time with them because I was in a relationship. But after my partner and I separated, I started to spend more time with my friends again and I realised something important: good friends will always be there for you, whether you’ve spent months, or even years, without speaking.
 
 2. Finding new ways to spend social time
 
 In high school, our friends were automatically by our side every day. But as adults, we have to make more of an effort to keep them close. I learnt that I needed to spend a bit of time and energy planning meetups and investing in my friendships. 
 
 One way I did this was by starting a scheduled, weekly Dungeons and Dragons game with a few old friends and some new ones. For you, it could be by:
 •	finding a few friends to compete in a ‘social’ sports league
 •	organising a regular pot-luck dinner at someone’s house
 •	finding local groups of people on sites like Meetup and Facebook to do whatever it is you’re into, whether it’s bushwalking, painting, photography or rock climbing.
 
 3. Setting boundaries wherever you need to
 
 Does your partner have difficult attitudes and behaviours, especially surrounding your social life? If they do, it doesn’t mean your relationship is wrong or needs to end. But it does mean that you’ll need to work on something very important: setting boundaries. Boundaries are a key feature of every healthy relationship, from your family to your friends to your romantic relationships, and they’re all about working out exactly where tricky behaviours need to stop. In a long-term relationship, healthy boundaries might look like:
 •	saying ‘no’ to any attempts to reduce your time spent with friends or to cut off certain people
 •	rejecting any attempts to hurt your feelings in ways that aim to control or manipulate you
 •	drawing a line at any attempts to invade your privacy.
 
 Initially, I was afraid to set a lot of these boundaries with my partner – what if she didn’t stick to them? Would it mean the end of our relationship? 
 
 In actual fact, I was surprised by how much progress she was able to make, and for a while, things were a lot better. Even though my partner and I didn’t end up staying together, I learnt how powerful and important it can be to care for yourself and your needs – and that’s important to learn in any relationship.

800,0,"11 things to do if you're feeling lonely
 
 Have you ever been in a crowded room and still felt lonely? The truth is, you can feel lonely anywhere, anytime – no matter how many people are physically around you. But if you’re sick of feeling solo and are keen to get connected, we’ve put together a guide to help make that happen.
 
 1. Start with small talk
 
 Small talk gets a bad wrap, but it’s actually a big part of helping break the ice. Try just asking the check-out person at the supermarket how their day’s going, or by sending a text to a friend. Yep, it might feel super awkward at first, but these small interactions can help you feel more comfortable in social situations.
 
 2. Hang out with like-minded people
 
 What are you into – video games, music, books? Joining a club is an awesome way to meet and connect with like-minded people.
 
 Check out your school, university or local community centre to see if they run any groups you might vibe on.
 
 Another option is Meetup. It brings together people who enjoy similar things or activities, whether that be fitness, photography, tech or, well … pretty much anything. And it’s free!
 
 3. Get active
 
 Okay, so exercise is great for keeping you well and less stressed, but have you thought about it as a way to meet new people?
 
 If you’re not already a footy legend or fiend on the basketball court, that’s totally fine. There are lots of exercise groups and ‘social’ sports leagues which are aimed at beginners.
 
 You may not be able to join an exercise or sports group at the moment, but you could start researching by doing a Google search or sending the organiser an email.
 
 If there are people in your life you want to get to know better, going for a walk or run with someone can be a great no-pressure way to connect.
 
 4. Jump online
 
 Whether you’re playing someone in your favourite game, or simply connecting in forums with like-minded people, chatting online is a great way to battle loneliness. You can take the leap from the comfort of your own computer while working on the skills that will help you feel less lonely in the long run.
 
 While sometimes it can be a mission to dodge the trolls and haters, a little searching should uncover an online haven filled with your kind of crew. The ReachOut Forums are a supportive, safe and anonymous space where people care about what’s happening for you, because they’ve been there, too. Check them out here.
 
 5. Give ‘yes’ a go
 
 Sometimes when you’re in a loneliness spiral, you might start turning down opportunities to hang out without even realising it. You might have had thoughts like “that wouldn’t be for me” or “they don’t actually want me to come to that”. But if you give ‘yes’ a go, you might find yourself enjoying things a lot more than you’d think.
 
 6. Back yourself to fly solo
 
 Don’t feel comfortable asking someone out for a hang? That’s cool. Grab a good book or even just your Reddit feed, and find a comfy spot to sit.
 
 There’s value in spending time on your own as well as trying to meet people. You might find you enjoy your own company more than you think.
 
 7. Sit with the feeling of loneliness
 
 It might feel weird to let yourself experience the feeling of loneliness when all you want to do is get rid of it. But denying your feelings and telling yourself to get over it can make you feel even worse. When you work on accepting your feelings, you can start to feel a bit better.
 
 You can do this by validating the emotion (e.g. ‘I’m feeling lonely, and it’s okay I feel this way’ or ‘Everyone feels this way sometimes’) and then talking to yourself like a friend (e.g. ‘I’m sorry you feel this way, but it will pass’). 
 
 8. Write it down
 
 Writing is a great way to battle loneliness, as it helps you to process your emotions and get a clearer idea of where your head's at.
 
 Whether it’s scribbling thoughts in a notebook, jotting down lyrics, or collecting what’s on your mind and downloading it to a Word doc, writing is a useful way to deal with feelings of isolation. You could try a journaling app such as Day One.
 
 9. Hang out with some non-humans
 
 Animals are great at making us feel connected and cared for. Pets, especially dogs and cats, can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and ease loneliness. If you’re not ready for the responsibility of owning a pet, you could always get into pet minding.
 
 Ask your neighbours and friends if they have a dog you could take for a walk occasionally, or a cat you could come over to visit and pet. If all else fails, head to a dog park! Added bonus, everyone loves animals, so hanging out with a pet is a guaranteed way to meet new people.
 
 10. Do some volunteering
 
 When you’re feeling isolated, volunteering helps to get you out into the world and connects you with the community around you. There are stacks of charities that need volunteers.
 
 Govolunteer.com.au is a great place to start looking for volunteering opportunities near you.
 
 11. Get some support if you need it
 
 If you’ve tried a couple of these steps and are still feeling lonely, don’t be afraid to seek professional help. If you need it, your GP can set you up with a mental health plan that will help you to access counselling or visit a psychologist. It’s okay to get the support you need.
 
 Don’t forget: everyone has times when they feel lonely. Taking even just a few of the steps above can help reduce your isolation and should help you start to feel better.
 
 What can I do now?
 •	Here are a gazillion ways to make new friends.
 •	Listen to how these young guys talk about how they cope with loneliness.
 •	Jump onto the ReachOut forums and connect to other young people.

825,0,"Overview of Mood Disorders
 
 Mood disorders are mental health disorders that involve emotional disturbances consisting of long periods of excessive sadness (depression), excessive joyousness or elation (mania), or both. Depression and mania represent the two extremes, or poles, of mood disorders.
 
 Mood disorders are sometimes called affective disorders. Affect (emphasis on the first syllable) means emotional state as revealed through facial expressions and gestures.
 
 Sadness and joy are part of the normal experience of everyday life and differ from the depression and mania that characterize mood disorders. Sadness is a natural response to loss, defeat, disappointment, trauma, or catastrophe.
 
 Grief or bereavement is the most common of the normal reactions to a loss or separation, such as the death of a loved one, divorce, or romantic disappointment. Usually, bereavement and loss do not cause persistent, incapacitating depression except in people predisposed to mood disorders.
 
 Did You Know...
 
 About 30% of people who visit a doctor say they feel depressed, but fewer than 10% have severe depression.
 
 A mood disorder is diagnosed when sadness or elation is overly intense, is accompanied by certain other typical symptoms, and impairs the ability to function physically, socially, and at work.
 
 When only depression occurs, it is termed a unipolar disorder. Other mood disorders, termed bipolar disorders, involve episodes of depression alternating with episodes of mania. Mania without depression (called unipolar mania) is very rare.
 
 About 30% of people report depression as one of their symptoms when they see their doctor. But fewer than 10% actually have severe depression. Nearly 4% of the U.S. population have a bipolar disorder.
 
 Mood disorders in children and adolescents can also occur.
 
 Having a mood disorder, particularly one that involves depression, increases the risk of other problems, such as inability to do daily activities and maintain relationships, loss of appetite, extreme anxiety, and alcohol use disorder. As many as 15% of people with untreated depression end their life by suicide.
 
",,
828,1,"Depression
 
 The disorder depression is a feeling of sadness intense enough to interfere with functioning and/or a decreased interest or pleasure in activities. It may follow a recent loss or other sad event but is out of proportion to that event and lasts beyond an appropriate length of time.
 
 Heredity, side effects of drugs, emotionally distressing events, changes in levels of hormones or other substances in the body, and other factors can contribute to depression.
 
 Depression can make people sad and sluggish and/or lose all interest and pleasure in activities they used to enjoy.
 
 Doctors base the diagnosis on symptoms.
 
 Antidepressants, psychotherapy, and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy can help.
 
 People often use the term depression to describe the sad or discouraged mood that results from emotionally distressing events, such as a natural disaster, a serious illness, or death of a loved one. People may also say they feel depressed at certain times, such as during the holidays (holiday blues) or on the anniversary of a loved one's death. However, such feelings do not usually represent a disorder. Usually, these feelings are temporary, lasting days rather than weeks or months, and occur in waves that tend to be tied to thoughts or reminders of the distressing event. Also, these feelings do not substantially interfere with functioning for any length of time.
 
 Overview of Depression
 
 Overview of Depression
 
 VIDEO
 
 After anxiety, depression is the most common mental health disorder. About 30% of people who visit a primary care practitioner have symptoms of depression, but fewer than 10% of these people have major depression.
 
 Depression typically develops during a person's mid teens, 20s, or 30s, although depression can begin at almost any age, including during childhood.
 
 An episode of depression, if untreated, typically lasts about 6 months but sometimes lasts for 2 years or more. Episodes tend to recur several times over a lifetime.
 
 Spotlight on Aging: Depression
 
 Spotlight on Aging: Depression
 
 Depression affects about 1 of every 6 older people. Some older people have had depression earlier in their life. Others develop it for the first time during old age.
 
 Causes of Depression in Older People
 
 Some causes of depression may be more common among older people. For example, older people may be more likely to experience emotionally distressing events that involve a loss, such as the death of a loved one or a loss of familiar surroundings, as when moving away from a familiar neighborhood. Other sources of stress, such as reduced income, a worsening chronic illness, a gradual loss of independence, or social isolation, may also contribute.
 
 Disorders that can lead to depression are common among older people. Such disorders include cancer, heart attack, heart failure, thyroid disorders, stroke, dementia, and Parkinson disease.
 
 Depression Versus Dementia
 
 In older people, depression can cause symptoms that resemble those of dementia: slower thinking, decreased concentration, confusion, and difficulty remembering. However, doctors can distinguish depression from dementia because when depression is treated, people with depression regain their mental function. People with dementia do not. Also, people with depression may complain bitterly about their memory loss and rarely forget important current events or personal matters. In contrast, people with dementia often deny memory loss.
 
 Diagnosis of Depression in Older People
 
 Depression is often difficult to diagnose among older people for several reasons:
 
 The symptoms may be less noticeable because older people may not work or may have less social interaction.
 
 Some people believe that depression is a weakness and are reluctant to tell anyone that they are experiencing sadness or other symptoms.
 
 The absence of emotion may be interpreted as indifference rather than depression.
 
 Family members and friends may regard a depressed person's symptoms simply as evidence that the person is getting older.
 
 The symptoms may be attributed to another disorder, such as dementia.
 
 Because depression may be difficult to identify, many doctors routinely ask older people questions about their mood. Family members should be alert for subtle changes in personality, especially lack of enthusiasm and spontaneity, loss of sense of humor, and new forgetfulness.
 
 Treatment of Depression in Older People
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the antidepressants used most often for older people who are depressed because SSRIs are less likely to have side effects. Citalopram and escitalopram are particularly useful.
 
 Causes of Depression
 
 The exact cause of depression is unclear, but a number of factors may make depression more likely. Risk factors include
 
 A family tendency (heredity)
 
 Emotionally distressing events, particularly those involving a loss
 
 Female sex, possibly involving changes in hormone levels
 
 Certain physical disorders
 
 Side effects of certain drugs
 
 Depression does not reflect a weakness of character and may not reflect a personality disorder, childhood trauma, or poor parenting. Social class, race, and culture do not appear to affect the chance that people will experience depression during their lifetime.
 
 Genetic factors contribute to depression in about half the people who have it. For example, depression is more common among first-degree relatives (particularly in an identical twin) of people with depression. Genetic factors can affect the function of substances that help nerve cells communicate (neurotransmitters). Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine are neurotransmitters that may be involved in depression.
 
 Women are more likely than men to experience depression, although the reasons are not entirely clear. Of physical factors, hormones are the ones most involved. Changes in hormone levels can cause mood changes shortly before menstruation (as part of premenstrual syndrome ), during pregnancy, and after childbirth. Some women become depressed during pregnancy or during the first 4 weeks after giving birth (called baby blues or, if the depression is more serious, postpartum depression ). Abnormal thyroid function, which is fairly common among women, may also be a factor.
 
 Depression may occur with or be caused by a number of physical disorders and factors. Physical disorders may cause depression directly (as when a thyroid disorder affects hormone levels) or indirectly (as when rheumatoid arthritis causes pain and disability). Often, a physical disorder both directly and indirectly causes depression. For example, AIDS may cause depression directly if the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, damages the brain. AIDS may cause depression indirectly by having an overall negative effect on the person’s life.
 
 Many people report feeling sadder in late autumn and winter and blame this tendency on the shortening of daylight hours and colder temperatures. However, in some people, such sadness is severe enough to be considered a type of depression (called seasonal affective disorder).
 
 The use of some prescription drugs, such as some beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), can cause depression. For unknown reasons, corticosteroids often cause depression when the body produces them in large amounts as part of a disorder (as in Cushing syndrome ), but when they are given as a drug, they tend to cause hypomania (a less severe form of mania) or, rarely, mania . Sometimes stopping a drug can cause temporary depression.
 
 A number of mental health disorders can predispose a person to depression. They include certain anxiety disorders , alcohol use disorder , other substance use disorders , and schizophrenia . People who have had depression are more likely to have it again.
 
 Emotionally distressing events, such as loss of a loved one, can sometimes trigger depression, but usually only in people who are predisposed to depression, such as those who have family members with depression. However, depression may arise or worsen without any apparent or significant life stresses.
 
 TABLE
 
 Some Causes of Depression	icon
 
 Symptoms of Depression
 
 Symptoms of depression typically develop gradually over days or weeks and can vary greatly. For example, a person who is becoming depressed may appear sluggish and sad or irritable and anxious.
 
 Many people with depression cannot experience emotions—including grief, joy, and pleasure—in a normal way. The world may appear to have become colorless and lifeless. They lose interest or pleasure in activities that they used to enjoy.
 
 Depressed people may be preoccupied with intense feelings of guilt and self-denigration and may not be able to concentrate. They may experience feelings of despair, loneliness, and worthlessness. They are often indecisive and withdrawn, feel helpless and hopeless, and think about death and suicide .
 
 Most depressed people have difficulty falling asleep and awaken repeatedly, particularly early in the morning. Some people with depression sleep more than usual.
 
 Poor appetite and weight loss may lead to emaciation, and in women, menstrual periods may stop. However, overeating and weight gain are common in people with mild depression.
 
 Some depressed people neglect personal hygiene or even their children, other loved ones, or pets. Some complain of having a physical illness, with various aches and pains.
 
 The term depression is used to describe several related disorders:
 
 Major depressive disorder
 
 Persistent depressive disorder
 
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
 
 Major depressive disorder
 
 People with major depressive disorder are depressed most days for at least 2 weeks. They may appear miserable. Their eyes may be full of tears, their brows may be furrowed, and the corners of the mouth may be turned down. They may slump and avoid eye contact. They may hardly move, show little facial expression, and speak in a monotone.
 
 Did You Know...
 
 Depression involves more than feeling sad all the time: People may feel worthless and guilty, lose interest in their normal pleasures, have sleep disorders, or lose or gain weight.
 
 Persistent depressive disorder
 
 People with persistent depressive disorder have been depressed for most of the time for 2 years or more.
 
 Symptoms begin gradually, often during adolescence, and may last for years or decades. How many symptoms are present at one time varies, and sometimes symptoms are less severe than those in major depression.
 
 People with this disorder may be gloomy, pessimistic, skeptical, humorless, and incapable of having fun. Some are passive, lack energy, and keep to themselves. Some constantly complain and are quick to criticize others and reproach themselves. They may be preoccupied with inadequacy, failure, and negative events, sometimes to the point of morbid enjoyment of their own failures.
 
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
 
 Severe symptoms occur before most menstrual periods and disappear after they end. Symptoms cause substantial distress and/or greatly interfere with functioning. Symptoms are similar to those of premenstrual syndrome but are more severe, causing great distress and interfering with functioning at work and social interactions.
 
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder may first appear any time after girls start to menstruate. It may worsen as women approach menopause but ends after menopause. It occurs in about 2 to 6% of women who are menstruating.
 
 Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder have mood swings, suddenly becoming sad and tearful. They are irritable and anger easily. They feel very depressed, hopeless, anxious, and on edge. They may feel overwhelmed or out of control. They often put themselves down.
 
 As with other types of depression, women with this disorder may lose interest in their usual activities, have difficulty concentrating, and feel tired and without energy. They may eat too much and crave certain foods. They may sleep too little or too much.
 
 Like many women whose period is about to start, these women may have tender, swollen breasts and/or achy muscles and joints. They may feel bloated and gain weight.
 
 Specifiers
 
 Doctors use certain terms to describe specific symptoms that can occur in people with depression. These terms include
 
 Anxious distress: People feel tense and unusually restless. They have difficulty concentrating because they worry or fear that something awful may happen or that they may lose control of themselves.
 
 Mixed: People also have three or more symptoms of mania . These symptoms include feeling exuberant and/or overly confident, talking more than usual, sleeping little, and racing thoughts. These people do not have all the symptoms required for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder , but they are at risk of developing it.
 
 Melancholic: People no longer take pleasure in any activities they used to enjoy. They appear sluggish, sad, and despondent. They speak little, stop eating, and lose weight. They may feel excessively or inappropriately guilty. They often awake early in the morning and cannot go back to sleep.
 
 Atypical: People may temporarily cheer up when something good happens, such as a visit from their children. They have an increased appetite, resulting in weight gain. They may sleep for long periods of time. They are excessively sensitive to perceived criticism or rejection. They may feel weighted down, as if they can hardly move their legs.
 
 Psychotic: People have false beliefs (delusions), often of having committed unpardonable sins or crimes, of having incurable or shameful disorders, or of being watched or persecuted. People may have hallucinations, usually of voices accusing them of various misdeeds or condemning them to death.
 
 Catatonic: People are very withdrawn. Thinking, speech, and general activity may slow down so much that all voluntary activities stop. Some people mimic others’ speech (echolalia) or movements (echopraxia).
 
 Seasonal: Episodes of depression occur every year at a particular time of year, usually starting in the fall or winter and ending in the spring. These episodes are more common in extreme northern and southern latitudes, where the winter season is typically longer and harsher. People are sluggish. They lose interest in and withdraw from their usual activities. They may also sleep too much and overeat.
 
 Suicide
 
 Thoughts of death are among the most serious symptoms of depression. Many depressed people want to die or feel they are so worthless that they should die. As many as 15% of untreated depressed people end their life by suicide .
 
 A suicide threat is an emergency. When people threaten to kill themselves, a doctor may hospitalize them so that they can be supervised until treatment reduces the risk of suicide. The risk is especially high in the following situations:
 
 When depression is not treated or is inadequately treated
 
 When treatment is started (when people are becoming more active mentally and physically but their mood is still dark)
 
 When people have a significant anniversary
 
 When people alternate between depression and mania (bipolar disorder )
 
 When people feel very anxious
 
 When people are drinking alcohol or taking recreational drugs
 
 In the weeks to months after people have attempted suicide, particularly if they used a violent method
 
 Substance use
 
 People with depression are more likely to use alcohol or other recreational drugs in an attempt to help them sleep or feel less anxious. However, depression leads to alcohol use and other substance use disorders less often than was once thought.
 
 People are also more likely to smoke heavily and to neglect their health. Thus, the risk of developing or worsening other disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , is increased.
 
 Other effects of depression
 
 Depression may reduce the immune system's ability to respond to foreign or dangerous invaders, such as microorganisms or cancer cells. As a result, people with depression may be more likely to get infections.
 
 Depression increases the risk of heart and blood vessel disorders (such as heart attacks) and stroke. The reason may be that depression causes certain physical changes that increase this risk. For example, the body produces more of the substances that help blood clot (clotting factors), and the heart is less able to change how fast it beats in response to different situations.
 
 Diagnosis of Depression
 
 A doctor's evaluation
 
 Tests to identify disorders that can cause depression
 
 A doctor is usually able to diagnose depression based on symptoms. Doctors use specific lists of symptoms (criteria) to diagnose the different types of depressive disorders. To help distinguish depression from ordinary changes in mood, doctors determine whether the symptoms are causing significant distress or are impairing the person's ability to function. A previous history of depression or a family history of depression helps support the diagnosis.
 
 Excessive worrying, panic attacks, and obsessions are common in depression and may lead the doctor to incorrectly think that the person has an anxiety disorder .
 
 In older people, depression may be difficult to notice, especially if they do not work or have little social interaction. Also, depression may be mistaken for dementia because it can cause similar symptoms, such as confusion and difficulty concentrating and thinking clearly. However, when such symptoms are caused by depression, they resolve when depression is treated. When dementia is the cause, they do not resolve.
 
 Standardized questionnaires are used to help identify depression and determine how severe it is, but they cannot be used alone to diagnose depression. Two such questionnaires are the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, conducted verbally by an interviewer, and the Beck Depression Inventory, a self-administered questionnaire. For older people, there is a Geriatric Depression Scale questionnaire. Doctors also ask people whether they have any thoughts or plans to harm themselves. Such thoughts indicate that depression is severe.
 
 Testing
 
 No test can confirm depression. However, laboratory tests may help a doctor determine whether depression is caused by a hormonal or other physical disorder. For example, blood tests are usually done to detect a thyroid disorder or vitamin deficiency . In younger people, tests may be done to detect drug use.
 
 A thorough neurologic examination is done to check for Parkinson disease , which causes some of the same symptoms.
 
 People who have severely disturbed sleep may need to have testing (polysomnography ) to distinguish sleep disorders from depression.
 
 Treatment of Depression
 
 Support
 
 Psychotherapy
 
 Drugs, mainly antidepressants
 
 Most people with depression do not require hospitalization. However, some people should be hospitalized, especially if they are contemplating suicide or have attempted it, are frail because of weight loss, or are at risk of heart problems because of severe agitation.
 
 Treatment depends the severity and type of depression:
 
 Mild depression: Support (including frequent doctor visits and education) and psychotherapy
 
 Moderate to severe depression: Drugs, psychotherapy, or both and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy
 
 Seasonal depression: Phototherapy
 
 Depression can usually be treated successfully. If a cause (such as a drug or another disorder) can be identified, it is corrected first, but drugs to treat depression may also be needed.
 
 Support
 
 Doctors may schedule visits or telephone calls every week or every other week for people with depression. Doctors explain to them and their family members that depression has physical causes and requires specific treatment, which is usually effective. Doctors reassure them that depression does not reflect a character flaw, such as weakness. It is important for family members to understand the disorder, be involved in treatment, and provide support.
 
 Learning about depression can help people understand and deal with the disorder. For example, people learn that the path to recovery is often bumpy and that episodes of sadness and dark thoughts may recur but they will stop. Thus, people can put any setbacks in perspective and are more likely to continue their treatment and not give up.
 
 Becoming more active—taking walks and exercising regularly—can help, as can interacting more with others.
 
 Support groups (such as the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance—DBSA ) can help by providing a forum to share common experiences and feelings.
 
 Psychotherapy
 
 Psychotherapy alone may be just as effective as drug therapy for mild depression. When used with drugs, it can be useful for severe depression.
 
 Individual or group psychotherapy can help people with depression gradually resume former responsibilities and adapt to the normal pressures of life. Interpersonal therapy focuses on the person's past and present social roles, identifies problems with how the person interacts with other people, and provides guidance as the person adjusts to changes in life roles. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help change hopelessness and negative thinking.
 
 Drug therapy for depression
 
 Several types of antidepressants are available (see table Drugs Used to Treat Depression ). They include the following:
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
 
 Newer antidepressants
 
 Heterocyclic antidepressants
 
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
 
 Ketamine-like drugs
 
 Psychostimulants , such as dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate, as well as other drugs, are sometimes used, often with antidepressants. Psychostimulants are used to increase mental alertness and awareness.
 
 St. John’s wort , an herbal dietary supplement, is sometimes used to relieve mild depression, although its effectiveness is not proven. Due to potentially harmful interactions between St. John’s wort and many prescription drugs, people interested in taking this herbal supplement need to discuss possible drug interactions with their doctor.
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy (in the past sometimes called shock therapy) is sometimes used to treat people with severe depression, including people who are psychotic, threatening to commit suicide, or refusing to eat. It is also used to treat depression during pregnancy when drugs are ineffective.
 
 This type of therapy is usually very effective and can relieve depression quickly, unlike most antidepressants, which can take up to several weeks. The speed with which it takes effect can save lives. After electroconvulsive therapy is stopped, episodes of depression can recur. To help prevent them, doctors often prescribe antidepressants.
 
 For electroconvulsive therapy, electrodes are placed on the head, and an electrical current is applied to induce a seizure in the brain. For reasons that are not understood, the seizures relieve depression. Usually, at least five to seven treatments, one treatment every other day, are given.
 
 Because the electrical current can cause muscle contractions and pain, general anesthesia is required during treatments. Electroconvulsive therapy may cause some temporary memory loss and, rarely, permanent memory loss.
 
 Phototherapy
 
 Phototherapy using a light therapy box is the most effective treatment for seasonal depression but may be helpful for other types of depressive disorders.
 
 Phototherapy involves sitting a specific distance from a light box that provides light with the necessary intensity. People are instructed not to look directly at the light and to remain in front of the light for 30 to 60 minutes a day. Phototherapy can be done at home.
 
 If people go to sleep and get up late, phototherapy is most effective in the morning. If people go to sleep and get up early, phototherapy is most effective between the late afternoon and early evening.
 
 Other therapies
 
 Other therapies that stimulate the brain may be tried when other treatments are ineffective. They include
 
 Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
 
 Stimulation of the vagus nerve
 
 The stimulated cells are thought to release chemical messengers (neurotransmitters), which help regulate mood and may thus relieve symptoms of depression. These therapies may help people with severe depression that does not respond to drugs or psychotherapy.
 
 For repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, an electromagnetic coil is placed against the forehead near an area of the brain thought to be involved in regulating mood. The electromagnet produces painless magnetic pulses that doctors think stimulate nerve cells in the targeted area of the brain. The most common side effects are headaches and discomfort near where the coil was placed.
 
 For vagus nerve stimulation, a device that looks like a heart pacemaker (vagus nerve stimulator) is implanted under the left collarbone and is connected to the vagus nerve in the neck with a wire that runs under the skin. (The pair of vagus nerves run from the brain stem, located near the base of the skull, through the neck and down each side of the chest and abdomen to organs, such as the heart and lungs.) The device is programmed to periodically stimulate the vagus nerve with a painless electrical signal. It may be useful for depression when other treatments are ineffective, but it usually takes 3 to 6 months to take effect. Side effects of vagus nerve stimulation include hoarseness, cough, and deepening of the voice when the nerve is stimulated.
 
 Antidepressants
 
 Types of antidepressants include
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
 
 Newer antidepressants
 
 Heterocyclic antidepressants
 
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
 
 Most antidepressants must be taken regularly for at least several weeks before they begin to work. Most people need to take antidepressants for 6 to 12 months to prevent relapses. People over 50 may have to take them for up to 2 years.
 
 Side effects vary with each type of antidepressant. Sometimes when treatment with one drug does not relieve depression, a different type (class) or a combination of antidepressant drugs is prescribed.
 
 Risk of suicide after starting an antidepressant has been in the news. A few people do become more agitated, depressed, and anxious shortly after an antidepressant is started or after the dose is increased. Some people, especially younger children and adolescents, become increasingly suicidal if these symptoms are not detected and rapidly treated. This finding was first reported with SSRIs, but the risk probably does not differ among classes of antidepressants. The person's doctor should be notified if symptoms worsen after antidepressants are started or the dose is increased (or for any reason). Because having suicidal thoughts is also a symptom of depression, doctors may have difficulty determining what role antidepressants play in suicidal thoughts and behavior. Some studies cast doubt on the connection.
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are now the most commonly used class of antidepressants. SSRIs are effective in treating depression as well as other mental health disorders that often coexist with depression.
 
 Although SSRIs can cause nausea, diarrhea, tremor, weight loss, and headache, these side effects are usually mild or go away with continued use. Most people tolerate the side effects of SSRIs better than the side effects of heterocyclic antidepressants . SSRIs are less likely to adversely affect the heart than heterocyclic antidepressants.
 
 However, a few people may seem more agitated, depressed, and anxious the first week after they start SSRIs or the dose is increased. These people, especially younger children and adolescents, may become increasingly suicidal if these symptoms are not detected and rapidly treated. People taking SSRIs and their loved ones should be warned of this possibility and instructed to call their doctor if symptoms worsen with treatment. However, because people with untreated depression also sometimes commit suicide, people and their doctors must balance this risk against the risk of drug treatment.
 
 Also, with long-term use, SSRIs may have additional side effects, such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction (in one third of people). Some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, cause loss of appetite. During the first few weeks after SSRIs are started, people may feel drowsy during the day, but this effect is temporary.
 
 Abruptly stopping some of the SSRIs may result in a discontinuation syndrome that includes dizziness, anxiety, irritability, fatigue, nausea, chills, and muscle aches.
 
 Newer antidepressants
 
 Newer antidepressants are as effective and safe as SSRIs and have similar side effects. These drugs include
 
 Norepinephrine- dopamine reuptake inhibitors (such as bupropion)
 
 Serotonin modulators (such as mirtazapine and trazodone)
 
 Serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (such as venlafaxine and duloxetine)
 
 As may occur with SSRIs, the risk of suicide may be temporarily increased when these drugs are first started, and abruptly stopping serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors may result in a discontinuation syndrome.
 
 Other side effects vary depending on the drug (see table below).
 
 Heterocyclic (including tricyclic) antidepressants
 
 Heterocyclic antidepressants, once the mainstay of treatment, are now used infrequently because they have more side effects than other antidepressants. They often cause drowsiness and lead to weight gain. They can also cause an increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure when a person stands (called orthostatic hypotension ). Other side effects, called anticholinergic effects , include blurred vision, dry mouth, confusion, constipation, and difficulty starting to urinate. Anticholinergic effects are often more severe in older people.
 
 Abruptly stopping heterocyclic antidepressants, as with SSRIs, may result in a discontinuation syndrome.
 
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
 
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are very effective but are rarely prescribed except when other antidepressants have not worked. People who use MAOIs must adhere to a number of dietary restrictions and take special precautions to avoid a serious reaction involving a sudden, severe rise in blood pressure with a severe, throbbing headache (hypertensive crisis). This crisis can cause a stroke. Precautions include
 
 Not eating foods or beverages that contain tyramine, such as beer on tap, red wines (including sherry), liqueurs, overripe foods, salami, aged cheeses, fava or broad beans, yeast extracts (marmite), canned figs, raisins, yogurt, cheese, sour cream, pickled herring, caviar, liver, extensively tenderized meats, and soy sauce
 
 Not taking pseudoephedrine, contained in many over-the-counter cough and cold remedies
 
 Not taking dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant), reserpine (an antihypertensive drug), or meperidine (an analgesic)
 
 Carrying an antidote, such as chlorpromazine tablets, at all times and, if a severe, throbbing headache occurs, taking the antidote at once and going to the nearest emergency room
 
 People who take MAOIs should also avoid taking other types of antidepressants, including heterocyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, bupropion, serotonin modulators, and serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Taking an MAOI with another antidepressant can cause a dangerously high body temperature, breakdown of muscle, kidney failure, and seizures. These effects, called neuroleptic malignant syndrome , can be fatal.
 
 Abruptly stopping MAOIs, as with SSRIs, may result in a discontinuation syndrome.

 Drugs Used to Treat Depression	icon
 
 Ketamine-like drug
 
 Ketamine is an anesthetic drug. However, researchers have learned that brain mechanisms affected by ketamine play a role in depression and that, when given at sub-anesthetic doses, can produce rapid though usually transient improvements in depressive symptoms. Recently, esketamine, a form of ketamine, was given Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for people with m",,
873,1,"Suicidal Behavior
 
 Suicidal behavior includes completed suicide and attempted suicide. Thoughts and plans about suicide are called suicide ideation.
 
 Suicide usually results from the interaction of many factors, usually including depression.
 
 Some methods, such as guns, are more likely to result in death, but choice of a less lethal method does not necessarily mean that the intent was less serious.
 
 Any suicide threat or suicide attempt must be taken seriously, and help and support should be provided.
 
 A telephone hotline is available for people who are considering suicide.
 
 (See also Suicidal Behavior in Children and Adolescents.)
 
 Suicidal behavior includes the following:
 
 Completed suicide: An intentional act of self-harm that results in death.
 
 Attempted suicide: An act of self-harm that is intended to result in death but does not. A suicide attempt may or may not result in injury.
 
 Nonsuicidal self-injury is an act of self-harm that is not intended to result in death. Such acts include inflicting scratches on the arms, burning oneself with a cigarette, and overdosing on vitamins. Nonsuicidal self-injury may be a way to reduce tension or may be a plea for help from people who still wish to live. These acts should not be dismissed lightly.
 
 Information about the frequency of suicide comes mainly from death certificates and inquest reports and probably underestimates the true rate. Even so, suicidal behavior is an all-too-common health problem. Suicidal behavior occurs in men and women of all ages, races, creeds, incomes, educational levels, and sexual orientations. There is no typical suicide profile.
 
 Completed suicide worldwide
 
 Worldwide, almost 800,000 people die by suicide every year.
 
 Suicide was the second leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 29 years.
 
 Evidence suggests that for each person who dies by suicide, there are many more people who attempt suicide. This ratio varies widely by country, region, sex, age, and method.
 
 Completed suicide in the United States
 
 In the United States, there were almost 47,000 completed suicides in 2017. On average, there are about 129 suicides each day.
 
 In 2016, the suicide rate was
 
 Highest in people aged 45 to 64
 
 2nd highest in people aged 85 and over
 
 As a leading cause of death, suicide ranks 10th overall. Among younger people, suicide ranks as follows:
 
 2nd among people aged 10 to 34
 
 4th among those aged 35 to 54
 
 8th among those aged 55 to 64
 
 In all age groups, men who commit suicide outnumber women almost 4 to 1. The reasons are unclear, but the following may be involved:
 
 When men have problems, they are less likely to seek help—from friends and/or health care practitioners.
 
 Alcohol abuse and substance use disorders , which appear to contribute to suicidal behavior, are more common among men.
 
 Men are more aggressive and use more lethal means when they attempt suicide.
 
 The number of suicides in men includes suicides in the military and among veterans. Both groups have a higher proportion of men to women.
 
 In 2016, the suicide rate was highest among American Indians and Alaska Natives and the second highest among non-Hispanic whites.
 
 Did You Know?
 
 Suicide is a leading cause of death among young people, but the rate of completed suicides is highest in people aged 45 to 64 and second highest in people aged 85 and over.
 
 Men are more likely to commit suicide than women.
 
 For every person who commits suicide, there are many more who attempt it.
 
 Attempted suicide in the United States
 
 Each year in the United States, over 1 million people attempt suicide. There are about 25 attempts for every completed suicide. Many people make repeated attempts. However, only 5 to 10% of people who make an attempt eventually die by suicide. Attempted suicide is particularly common among adolescent girls. Girls aged 15 to 19 make 100 suicide attempts for every suicide completed, and they attempt suicide 100 times more often than boys. Across all age groups, women attempt suicide 2 or 3 times as often as men, but men are 4 times more likely to die in their attempts. Older people attempt suicide 4 times for every completed suicide.
 
 In people who attempt suicide, life expectancy is significantly reduced. Much of the decrease in life expectancy seems to result from physical disorders rather than later, completed suicide.
 
 Causes of Suicidal Behavior
 
 About one in six people who kill themselves leaves a suicide note, which sometimes provides clues as to why.
 
 Suicidal behaviors usually result from the interaction of several factors.
 
 The most common factor that contributes to suicidal behavior is
 
 Depression
 
 Depression, including the depression that is part of bipolar disorder , is involved in over 50% of attempted suicides and an even higher percentage of completed suicides. Depression can occur out of the blue, be triggered by a recent loss or other distressing event, or result from a combination of factors. In people with depression, marital problems, recent arrest or trouble with the law, unhappy or ended love affairs, disputes with parents or bullying (among adolescents), or the recent loss of a loved one (particularly among older people) may trigger a suicide attempt. The risk of suicide is higher if people with depression also have significant anxiety .
 
 People with certain medical disorders may become depressed and attempt or complete suicide. Most disorders associated with increased suicide rates either directly affect the nervous system and brain (as occurs in AIDS , multiple sclerosis , temporal lobe epilepsy , head injuries ) or involve treatments that can cause depression (such as certain drugs used to treat high blood pressure).
 
 In older people, about 20% of suicides may at least partly be a response to serious chronic and painful physical disorders.
 
 Traumatic childhood experiences, including physical and sexual abuse, increase the risk of attempted suicides, perhaps because depression is common among people who have had such experiences.
 
 Use of alcohol may intensify depression, which, in turn, makes suicidal behavior more likely. Alcohol also reduces self-control. About 30% of people who attempt suicide drink alcohol before the attempt, and about half of them are intoxicated at the time. Because alcoholism, particularly binge drinking, often causes deep feelings of remorse during dry periods, alcoholics are suicide-prone even when sober.
 
 Almost all other mental disorders also put people at risk of suicide.
 
 People with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders may have delusions (fixed false beliefs) that they find impossible to cope with, or they may hear voices (auditory hallucinations) commanding them to kill themselves. Also, people with schizophrenia are prone to depression.
 
 People with borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder , especially those with a history of violent behavior, are also at higher risk of suicide. People with these disorders tolerate frustration poorly and react to stress impetuously, sometimes leading to self-harm or aggressive behavior.
 
 Living alone increases the risk of suicidal behavior. People who have been separated, divorced, or widowed are more likely to complete suicide. Suicide is less common among people who are in a secure relationship than among single people.

 Antidepressants and the risk of suicide
 
 The risk of suicide attempts is greatest in the month before starting antidepressant treatment, and the risk of death by suicide is no higher after antidepressants are started. However, antidepressants slightly increase the frequency of suicidal thoughts and attempts (but not of completed suicide) in children, adolescents, and young people. So parents of children and adolescents should be warned, and children and adolescents should be carefully monitored for side effects such as increased anxiety, agitation, restlessness, irritability, anger, or a shift into hypomania (when people feel full of energy and cheerful but are often easily irritated, distracted, and agitated), especially during the first few weeks after they start taking the drug.
 
 Because of public health warnings about the possible association between taking antidepressants and an increased risk of suicide, doctors started prescribing antidepressants more than 30% less often for children and young people. However, during this same time, suicide rates among young people temporarily increased by 14%. Thus, it is possible that by discouraging drug treatment of depression, these warnings resulted in more, not fewer, deaths by suicide.
 
 When people with depression are given antidepressants, doctors take certain precautions to reduce the risk of suicidal behavior:
 
 Giving people antidepressants in amounts that would not cause death
 
 Scheduling more frequent visits when treatment is first started
 
 Clearly warning people and their family members and significant others to be alert for worsening symptoms or suicidal ideation
 
 Instructing people and their family members and significant others to immediately call the doctor who prescribed the antidepressant or to seek care elsewhere if symptoms worsen or suicidal thoughts occur
 
 Did You Know?
 
 Taking antidepressants has been linked with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts, but not taking antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide much more.
 
 Although most men and women who kill themselves use guns, more than twice as many men complete suicide this way.
 
 Methods
 
 The choice of method is often influenced by cultural factors and availability of the means to commit suicide (for example, a gun). It may or may not reflect the seriousness of intent. Some methods (such as jumping from a tall building) make survival virtually impossible, whereas other methods (such as overdosing on drugs) make rescue possible. However, even if a person uses a method that proves not to be fatal, the intent may have been just as serious as that of a person whose method was fatal.
 
 Suicide attempts most often involve drug overdose and self-poisoning. Violent methods, such as shooting and hanging, are uncommon among suicide attempts because they usually result in death.
 
 Most completed suicides involve guns. In the United States, guns are used in about 50% of suicides. Men use this method more than women. Other methods include hanging, poisoning, jumping from a height, and cutting. Some methods, such as driving off a cliff, can endanger others.
 
 Worldwide, poisoning with pesticides accounts for about 30% of completed suicides.
 
 Prevention of Suicidal Behavior
 
 Although some attempted or completed suicides come as a shock even to family members and friends, many people give clear warnings. Any suicide threat or suicide attempt must be taken seriously. If it is ignored, a life may be lost.
 
 If a person is imminently threatening or has already attempted suicide, the police should be contacted immediately so that emergency services can arrive as soon as possible. Until help arrives, the person should be spoken to in a calm, supportive manner.
 
 A doctor may hospitalize people who have threatened or attempted suicide. Most states allow a doctor to hospitalize people against their wishes if the doctor believes that they are at high risk of harming themselves or other people.
 
 Suicide Intervention: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline
 
 Suicide Intervention: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline
 
 People threatening suicide are in crisis. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK) provides crisis intervention for such people throughout the United States. Suicide prevention centers are staffed by specially trained volunteers.
 
 When potentially suicidal people call the hotline, a volunteer does the following:
 
 Seeks to establish a relationship with them, reminding them of their identity (for example, by using their name repeatedly)
 
 May offer constructive help for the problem that brought on the crisis and encourage them to take positive action to resolve it
 
 May try to facilitate emergency face-to-face professional help for them
 
 Sometimes people call a hotline to say that they have already committed a suicidal act (for example, taken a drug overdose or turned on the gas) or are in the process of doing so. In such cases, the volunteer tries to obtain their address. If that is not possible, another volunteer contacts the police to trace the call and attempt a rescue. If possible, people are kept talking on the telephone until the police arrive.
 
 Management
 
 Doctors take any suicidal act seriously, regardless of whether the person actually intended to commit suicide or not.
 
 If people seriously injure themselves, doctors evaluate and treat the injury and typically admit the person to the hospital. If people have taken an overdose of a potentially lethal drug, doctors immediately take steps to prevent absorption of the drug and speed its elimination from the body. People are also given any available antidote and provided with supportive care, such as a breathing tube.
 
 After the initial evaluation, people who have attempted suicide are referred to a psychiatrist, who tries to identify problems that contributed to the attempt and plan appropriate treatment.
 
 To identify problems, psychiatrists do the following:
 
 Listen to what the person has to say
 
 Try to understand what made the person attempt suicide, what led up to the attempt, and where and how it occurred
 
 Ask about symptoms of mental disorders that increase the risk of suicidal behavior
 
 Ask whether the person is being treated for a mental disorder, including whether the person is taking any drugs to treat it
 
 Evaluate the person's mental state, looking for signs of depression, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, severe insomnia, other mental disorders, and alcohol or substance use and abuse
 
 Ask about personal and family relationships as well as social networks, because they are often relevant to the suicide attempt and the follow-up treatment
 
 Talk to close family members and friends, and ask them about the person's use of alcohol, marijuana, pain relievers, and drugs of abuse
 
 Help the person identify things that trigger thoughts of suicide and help the person plan ways to deal with the triggers
 
 Because depression increases the risk of suicidal behavior, doctors carefully monitor people with depression for suicidal behavior and thoughts.
 
 Some evidence suggests that using lithium, antidepressants, and antipsychotics to treat mood disorders in people who are at risk of suicide may reduce the number of completed suicides. Treating schizophrenia with clozapine reduces the risk of suicide.
 
 Impact of Suicidal Behavior
 
 Death by suicide has a marked emotional effect on all involved. Family, friends, and doctors may feel guilt, shame, and remorse at not having prevented the suicide. They may also feel anger toward the person. Eventually, they may realize that they could not have prevented the suicide.
 
 Sometimes a grief counselor or a self-help group can help family and friends deal with their feelings of guilt and sorrow. The primary care doctor or local mental health services (for example, at the county or state level) can often help locate these resources. In addition, national organizations, such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention , maintain directories of local support groups. Resources are also available on the Internet.
 
 The effect of attempted suicide is similar. However, family members and friends have the opportunity to resolve their feelings by responding appropriately to the person's cry for help.
 
 Physician Aid in Dying (formerly, Assisted Suicide)
 
 Physician aid in dying refers to the assistance given by physicians to people who wish to end their lives. It is very controversial because it reverses the doctor's usual goal, which is to preserve life. However, physician aid in dying is legal in 9 U.S. states (California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia. Assisted suicide is also legal in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada. In the rest of the United States, doctors can provide treatment intended to minimize physical and emotional suffering, but they cannot intentionally hasten death.
 
 Physician aid in dying is also legal in some other countries.

874,0,"Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
 
 Nonsuicidal self-injury is a self-inflicted act that causes pain or superficial damage but is not intended to cause death.
 
 Although the methods people use to hurt themselves, such as cutting their wrists with a razor blade, sometimes overlap with those of suicide attempts, nonsuicidal self-injury is different because people do not intend the acts to cause death. Often, people specifically state that they are not trying to kill themselves. In other cases, doctors presume people are not actually trying to die when they repeatedly do something that clearly cannot cause death—for example, burning themselves with cigarettes.
 
 However, the first time people hurt themselves, it may not be clear whether they actually intended to die. For example, people may think that they could kill themselves by taking an overdose of antibiotics or vitamins, take such dose, and then realize that such a dose is harmless.
 
 Even when self-injury does not cause death, people who injure themselves are probably more likely over the long term to attempt or commit suicide. Thus, doctors and family members should not lightly dismiss nonsuicidal self-injury.
 
 The most common examples of nonsuicidal self-injury include
 
 Cutting or stabbing the skin with a sharp object, such as a knife, razor blade, or needle
 
 Burning the skin, typically with a cigarette
 
 Nonsuicidal self-injury tends to start during early adolescence. It is more common among people who have other disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, an eating disorder, or substance use disorders (including alcohol abuse), and autism. Nonsuicidal self-injury is only slightly more common among girls than boys, whereas suicidal behavior is much more common among girls than boys. Most people stop hurting themselves when they get older.
 
 People often injure themselves repeatedly in a single session, creating several cuts or burns in the same location. Usually, people choose an area that is at once accessible and easily hidden by clothing, such as the forearms or front of the thighs. Typically, people also hurt themselves repeatedly, resulting in extensive scars from previous episodes. People are often preoccupied with thoughts about the injurious acts.
 
 Why people injure themselves is unclear, but self-injury may be
 
 A way to reduce tension or negative feelings
 
 A way to resolve interpersonal difficulties
 
 Self-punishment for perceived faults
 
 A plea for help
 
 Some people do not think their self-injury is a problem and thus tend not to seek or accept counseling.
 
 Diagnosis of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
 
 A doctor's evaluation
 
 First, doctors examine the person to determine whether any of the person's injuries require treatment.
 
 To diagnose nonsuicidal self-injury, doctors must determine whether the act was intended to cause death (suicidal behavior) or not (nonsuicidal self-injury). To do so, doctors evaluate the person's intent, reasons, and mood. People who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury may state that they harm themselves to obtain relief from negative feelings rather than to kill themselves. Or they may repeatedly use methods unlikely to result in death. However, people who engage in self-injury can and do attempt suicide. So doctors talk to other people who are close to the person about changes in the person's mood and stresses in the person's life so that they can evaluate the person's risk of suicide.
 
 If people do not think their self-injury is a problem, they may be reluctant to talk about it. Thus, to evaluate people who have injured themselves, doctors first try to help these people talk about their self-injury. To do so, doctors communicate the following:
 
 That they have heard the person and take the person's experiences seriously
 
 That they understand how the person feels and how those feelings could result in self-injury
 
 Doctors then try to determine the following:
 
 How people injure themselves and how many different ways they do it (for example, do they burn and cut themselves?)
 
 How often they injure themselves
 
 How long they have been injuring themselves
 
 What purpose injuring themselves serves
 
 How willing they are to participate in treatment
 
 Doctors also check for other mental disorders and try to estimate how likely people are to attempt suicide.
 
 Treatment of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
 
 Certain types of psychotherapy
 
 Treatment of any other disorders present
 
 Certain types of psychotherapy may help people who injure themselves. They include
 
 Dialectical behavior therapy
 
 Emotion regulation group therapy
 
 Dialectical behavior therapy provides weekly individual and group sessions for 1 year and a therapist who is available 24 hours a day by telephone. The therapist acts as a behavior coach. The aim is to help people find more appropriate ways of responding to stress—for example, to resist urges to behave self-destructively.
 
 Emotion-regulation group therapy involves 14 weeks of group therapy. It helps people become aware of, understand, and accept their emotions. This therapy helps people be willing to accept negative emotions as part of life and thus not to respond to such emotions so intensely and impulsively.
 
 No drugs have been approved for the treatment of nonsuicidal self-injury. However, naltrexone and certain atypical antipsychotics have been effective in some people.
 
 If people have other mental disorders (such as depression , eating disorders , substance use disorders , or borderline personality disorder ), such disorders are treated. If possible, people should be referred to a mental health care practitioner. Follow-up appointments are essential.",,
879,0,"Nonsuicidal Self-Injury in Children and Adolescents
 
 What is nonsuicidal self-injury?
 
 Nonsuicidal self-injury is when adults or children:
 
 Hurt themselves in ways that clearly aren't meant to cause death, such as scratching, cutting, or burning themselves
 
 Children who hurt themselves:
 
 Are usually teens
 
 May also abuse drugs or alcohol
 
 Aren't trying to kill themselves, although some later do try to commit suicide
 
 May be helped by therapy that helps them find other ways to manage their emotions and stress
 
 What causes children to hurt themselves?
 
 Children and teens who hurt themselves may be doing it to:
 
 Punish themselves
 
 Get attention
 
 Try to get help
 
 Manage anger or stress
 
 In some high schools, hurting yourself suddenly becomes a fad.
 
 Although the behavior isn't necessarily suicidal, some children are at increased risk of suicide. Those at increased risk include children who:
 
 Hurt themselves a lot
 
 Use several methods of hurting themselves
 
 Talk about suicide or have suicidal thoughts
 
 How can I help children who are hurting themselves?
 
 Because it's hard to tell which children are at risk of suicide, those who injure themselves should see a doctor who specializes in the problems of children and teens. Doctors will assess the risk of suicide and come up with a treatment plan.
 
 How do doctors treat children who hurt themselves?
 
 Doctors treat children who hurt themselves with:
 
 Therapy
 
 Sometimes, medicine",,
880,0,"Depression in Children and Adolescents
 
 What is depression?
 
 Just like adults, most children have times when they're sad or feel down. It's normal to have a low mood when something sad happens, such as losing a friend or family member or having a disappointment at school. That's not really depression. Depression is when:
 
 A low mood is so severe or lasts so long that people can't do their daily tasks or take part in otherwise enjoyable activities
 
 Depression in children:
 
 Is more common in adolescence
 
 Your child may be sad, uninterested, and sluggish or may be irritable, aggressive, and cranky
 
 Depression sometimes starts after something sad happens—but the child's feelings last longer and are more intense than seems normal
 
 Younger children are treated with therapy first, while teens are usually treated with therapy and medicine together
 
 What causes depression in children?
 
 Doctors don’t know exactly what causes depression, but risk is increased by:
 
 Having close family members who have depression
 
 Sad, emotional events such as the loss of a friend or death of a family member
 
 What are the symptoms of depression in children?
 
 Although some children will talk about feeling sad or depressed, many can't explain their emotions. Instead, they may:
 
 Feel bored or irritable
 
 Have no interest in favorite activities such as playing sports, watching TV, playing video games, or playing with friends
 
 Feel tired and out of energy
 
 Complain of stomach ache or headache
 
 Have problems thinking or paying attention
 
 Not sleep well, have nightmares, or sleep too much
 
 Give away things that are special to them
 
 These symptoms may cause children to lose friends and do worse in school.
 
 Some children think or talk about suicide. Always take suicidal behavior seriously and immediately take your child to the doctor or a hospital emergency department.
 
 How do doctors treat depression in children?
 
 Doctors treat depression with:
 
 Therapy
 
 Medicine (antidepressants)
 
 Doctors usually treat teens with both medicine and therapy. They usually treat younger children with therapy first, followed by medicine if needed.
 
 Depression often comes back, so children and teens should be treated for at least a year.",,
893,1,"Postpartum Depression
 
 Post means ""after,"" and partum means ""pregnancy,"" so postpartum refers to the time period after you have a baby. It's usually considered the first 6 weeks.
 
 Depression is feeling so sad and hopeless that you can't do your normal activities.
 
 What is postpartum depression?
 
 Postpartum depression is depression that starts during the weeks and months after having a baby.
 
 It’s common to feel sad or miserable in the first few days after giving birth—these feelings, called “the baby blues,” are normal and usually go away within 2 weeks
 
 Postpartum depression is a more serious mood change that lasts for weeks or months
 
 You have trouble doing daily activities and may lose interest in your baby
 
 About 1 in 10 women gets postpartum depression
 
 It can happen even if you never had depression before
 
 If untreated, postpartum depression can last for months or years
 
 Doctors treat postpartum depression with antidepressants and therapy
 
 Go to the hospital right away if you're thinking of suicide or having violent thoughts, such as hurting your baby.
 
 What causes postpartum depression?
 
 Postpartum depression may be caused by the sudden drop in hormone levels after your baby is born.
 
 Many women have no risk factors. But you’re more likely to get postpartum depression if you:
 
 Have depression before or during pregnancy—tell your doctor if you had depression before you got pregnant
 
 Had postpartum depression in a previous pregnancy
 
 Have sadness or depression during your period or while taking birth control
 
 Have family members who have depression

894,0,"Separation Anxiety and Stranger Anxiety
 
 As infants develop intellectually and emotionally, they quickly learn to recognize and become attached to their parents or primary caregivers. As this bond strengthens, infants often become anxious or afraid whenever parents leave or strangers appear. These fears are a normal part of infant development and should resolve with time.
 
 Separation anxiety
 
 Separation anxiety is a stage of normal development. During this stage, children develop anxiety when they are separated from their parents or primary caregivers. Separation anxiety typically begins when children are about 8 months old and becomes most intense when children are 10 to 18 months old. Children who are 8 to 18 months old often become frightened when they meet new people or visit new places. When separated from their parents or caregivers, particularly when away from home, they feel threatened and unsafe. They look to their parents and caregivers for safety and reassurance. Children this age who cry when their parents or caregivers leave the room are not ""spoiled."" Rather, crying indicates the children have developed a sense of attachment to their parents or caregivers. Crying in this situation is a positive reaction.
 
 Parents or caregivers may try playing peek-a-boo with children this age to reassure children that out of sight does not mean gone forever.
 
 Separation anxiety continues until children are about 24 months old. At this age, children have learned object permanence and have developed trust. Object permanence is the knowledge that something (such as their parents) still exists even when it is not seen or heard. Separation anxiety resolves because children have learned that their parents or caregivers still exist even when they cannot be seen. Children have learned to trust their parents or caregivers will eventually return.
 
 Usually, separation anxiety is not a cause for concern and does not require evaluation by a doctor.
 
 Separation anxiety differs from separation anxiety disorder , which occurs in older children. Children with this disorder typically refuse to go to school or preschool. If severe, separation anxiety disorder may interfere with a child's normal development.
 
 Parents should not limit or give up their separate activities in response to a child’s separation anxiety because doing so could interfere with the child's maturation and development.
 
 When parents are ready to go out or leave the child at a child care center, they can try the following:
 
 Making sure that any temporary caregiver is familiar to the child
 
 Encouraging the person caring for the child to distract the child with toys, a game, or another activity as the parents leave
 
 Limiting their response to the child's crying before they leave
 
 Remaining calm and reassuring
 
 Establishing routines at separations to ease the child's anxiety
 
 Feeding the child and letting the child nap before they leave (because separation anxiety may be worse when a child is hungry or tired)
 
 If a child cries when a parent goes to a another room in the home, the parent should call to the child from the other room, rather than immediately return to comfort the child. This response teaches the child that parents are still present even though the child cannot see them.
 
 Separation anxiety that lasts beyond age 2 years may or may not be a problem depending on how much it interferes with the child's development. For example, most children feel some fear when they begin preschool or kindergarten. If they are able to attend the program and their fear decreases with time, this fear is not an expression of separation anxiety. However, separation anxiety that keeps a child from attending child care or preschool or from playing normally with peers can be a sign of separation anxiety disorder. In such cases, children should be seen by a doctor.
 
 Stranger anxiety
 
 Children with stranger anxiety may cry when an unfamiliar person approaches. This anxiety is normal when
 
 It begins at about age 8 to 9 months.
 
 It resolves by age 2 years.
 
 Stranger anxiety is related to infants' learning to distinguish the familiar from the unfamiliar. How intense it is and how long it lasts vary greatly among children.
 
 Some infants and young children show a strong preference for one parent over another at a given age. They may suddenly see grandparents as strangers. Parents need to be aware that this behavior is to be expected and let grandparents know about it. Thus, misinterpretation of the child’s behavior can be avoided. Comforting the child and avoiding overreaction to the behavior are usually the only treatment needed.
 
 If a new sitter is coming, having the sitter spend some time with the family before the actual day is a good idea. When the day arrives, parents should plan to spend some time with the child and the sitter before they leave. Similarly, if grandparents are coming to watch the child for a few days while parents go away, they should arrive a day or two early.
 
 If a child needs to have a diagnostic test or be hospitalized, taking the child to the doctor’s office or hospital beforehand to see what it is like may help. Parents should also reassure the child that they will be waiting nearby and should specify exactly where.
 
 If stranger anxiety is very intense or lasts a long time, it may be a sign of more generalized anxiety . In such cases, the child should be seen by a doctor promptly. Doctors evaluate the family situation, parenting techniques, and the child's overall emotional state.",,
895,1,"Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)
 
 Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of physical and psychologic symptoms that start several days before and usually end a few hours after a menstrual period begins. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a form of PMS in which symptoms are so severe that they interfere with work, social activities, or relationships.
 
 PMS includes any combination of the following: becoming irritable, anxious, moody, or depressed or having headaches or sore, swollen breasts.
 
 Doctors base the diagnosis on symptoms, which are usually recorded daily by the woman.
 
 Consuming less sugar, salt, and caffeine and exercising may help relieve symptoms, as does taking certain supplements, pain relievers, birth control pills (sometimes), or antidepressants.
 
 Because so many symptoms, such as a bad mood, irritability, bloating, and breast tenderness, have been ascribed to PMS, defining and identifying PMS can be difficult.
 
 About 20 to 50% of women of childbearing age have PMS. About 5% have a severe form of PMS called premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
 
 PMS may occur partly because of the following:
 
 Estrogen and progesterone levels fluctuate during the menstrual cycle. Some women are more sensitive to these fluctuations.
 
 Some women may have a genetic make-up that makes them more susceptible to PMS.
 
 Serotonin levels tend to be lower in women with PMS. Serotonin is a substance that helps nerve cells communicate (a neurotransmitter) and is thought to help regulate mood.
 
 A deficiency of magnesium or calcium may contribute.
 
 The fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone may affect other hormones, such as aldosterone, which helps regulate salt and water balance. Excess aldosterone can cause fluid retention and bloating.
 
 Symptoms of PMS
 
 The type and intensity of PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman and from month to month in the same woman. The various physical and psychologic symptoms of PMS can temporarily upset a woman’s life.
 
 Symptoms may begin a few hours up to about 10 days before a menstrual period, and they often disappear completely a few hours after the period begins. During the years before menopause (called perimenopause ), women may have symptoms that persist through and after the menstrual period. Symptoms may become more severe during stress or during perimenopause. The symptoms of PMS may be followed each month by a painful period (cramps , or dysmenorrhea), particularly in adolescents.
 
 The most common symptoms are irritability, anxiety, agitation, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, lethargy, depression, and severe fatigue. Women may feel bloated and temporarily gain weight. Breasts may feel full and be painful. Women may have a sense of heaviness or pressure in the lower abdomen.
 
 Other disorders may worsen while PMS symptoms are occurring. They include the following:
 
 Seizure disorders, with more seizures than usual
 
 Connective tissue disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) or rheumatoid arthritis, with flare-ups
 
 Respiratory disorders, such as allergies and congestion of the nose and airways
 
 Migraines
 
 Mood disorders, such as depression or anxiety
 
 Sleep disturbances, such as sleeping too much or not sleeping enough
 
 Mood disorders can cause similar symptoms, and those symptoms may worsen just before a menstrual period, even in women who do not have PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
 
 In premenstrual dysphoric disorder , premenstrual symptoms are so severe that they interfere with work, social activities, or relationships. Interest in daily activities is greatly reduced, and some women may even become suicidal. Symptoms occur regularly before menstrual periods start and end when or shortly after periods start. Women may lose interest in their usual activities and have suicidal thoughts.

 Diagnosis of PMS
 
 For PMS, a doctor's evaluation
 
 For premenstrual dysphoric disorder, specific guidelines
 
 The diagnosis of PMS is based on symptoms. To identify PMS, doctors ask a woman to keep a daily record of her symptoms. This record helps the woman be aware of changes in her body and moods and helps doctors identify any regular symptoms and determine what treatment is best.
 
 If women have symptoms of depression , they may be given standardized tests for depression or be referred to a mental health care practitioner. However, doctors can usually distinguish PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder from mood disorders based on factors such as the timing of symptoms. If the symptoms disappear soon after the menstrual period begins, they are probably caused by PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
 
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
 
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder cannot be diagnosed until a woman has recorded her symptoms for at least two menstrual cycles. Doctors base the diagnosis on specific guidelines. The guidelines state that women must have a total of at least five of the symptoms that often occur in women with PMS (with at least one from each of the two lists below).
 
 The symptoms must include at least one of the following:
 
 Having changeable moods (for example, suddenly feeling sad and tearful)
 
 Being very irritable or angry or having more conflicts with other people
 
 Feeling very depressed or hopeless or being very critical of self
 
 Feeling anxious, tense, or on edge
 
 The symptoms must also include at least one of the following:
 
 A decreased interest in usual activities
 
 Difficulty concentrating
 
 Low energy or fatigue
 
 Noticeable changes in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings
 
 Problems sleeping (having problems going to or staying asleep or sleeping too much)
 
 Feelings of being overwhelmed or out of control
 
 Physical symptoms that often occur in women with PMS (such as tender breasts)
 
 Also, the symptoms must have occurred for most of the previous 12 months, and they must be severe enough to interfere with daily activities and function.
 
 Treatment of PMS
 
 General measures
 
 Sometimes drugs, including hormones and/or antidepressants
 
 PMS may be difficult to treat. No single treatment is effective for all women, and few woman have complete relief with any single type of treatment.
 
 General measures
 
 Women can try the following to help relieve PMS symptoms:
 
 Getting enough rest and sleep (at least 7 hours each night)
 
 Exercising regularly, which may help lessen bloating as well as irritability, anxiety, and insomnia (yoga and Tai Chi help some women)
 
 Using stress reduction techniques (meditation or relaxation exercises)
 
 Avoiding stressful activities
 
 Consuming more protein and less sugar and caffeine (including that in chocolate)
 
 Consuming more fruits, vegetables, milk, complex carbohydrates (for example, in breads, pastas, beans, and root vegetables), high-fiber foods, low-fat meats, and foods high in calcium and vitamin D
 
 Consuming less salt, which often reduces fluid retention and relieves bloating
 
 Avoiding certain foods and drinks (such as cola, coffee, hot dogs, potato chips, and canned foods)
 
 Certain dietary supplements may lessen PMS symptoms to some degree. These supplements include chasteberry extract from the agnus castus fruit, vitamin B6, and vitamin E. Women should talk to their doctor before they take any supplements, especially vitamin B6, which may be harmful if taken in high doses. Nerve damage is possible with as little as 200 milligrams of vitamin B6 a day.
 
 Did You Know...
 
 Taking birth control pills sometimes relieves symptoms but sometimes makes them worse, particularly in the first 6 weeks after starting.
 
 Drugs
 
 Taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help relieve headaches, pain due to abdominal cramps, and joint pain. To decrease the intensity of headaches or cramps, women can start taking NSAIDs a few days before their period starts.
 
 Hormone therapy may help. Options include the following:
 
 Birth control pills
 
 Progesterone vaginal suppositories
 
 Progesterone pills
 
 Injection of a long-acting progestin (a synthetic form of the female hormone progesterone) every 2 or 3 months
 
 Oral contraceptives that result in shorter menstrual periods or that increase the interval between periods to as much as 3 months may help some women.
 
 Women who have more severe PMS symptoms or premenstrual dysphoric disorder may benefit from taking antidepressants such as citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline. These drugs are used to prevent symptoms, and to be effective, they should be taken daily before symptoms begin or, for some women with PMS, taken daily the 2 weeks before menstrual periods begin. Taking these drugs after symptoms begin usually does not relieve symptoms. These drugs are most effective in reducing irritability, depression, and some other symptoms of PMS. Brexanolone, given intravenously, is now available for treatment of postpartum depression specifically, and may be particularly helpful if oral drugs are ineffective.
 
 If fluid retention is a problem, doctors may prescribe the diuretic spironolactone (which helps the kidneys eliminate salt and water from the body).
 
 Doctors may ask a woman to continue keeping a record of her symptoms so that they can judge the effectiveness of PMS treatment.
 
 For women who have premenstrual dysphoric disorder that persists despite other treatments, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (such as leuprolide or goserelin), given by injection, may help relieve symptoms. GnRH agonists are a synthetic form of a hormone produced by the body. GnRH agonists cause the ovaries to produce less estrogen and progesterone. Thus, they help control the rapid fluctuations in hormone levels that occur before menstrual periods and that contribute to symptoms. Women are usually also given estrogen plus a progestin, taken in a low dose by mouth or a patch.
 
 Researchers continue to evaluate other drugs as possible treatments for PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
 
 Surgery
 
 As a last resort for women who have severe symptoms that cannot be controlled with other treatments, doctors may offer surgery. Removing the ovaries eliminates menstrual cycles and thus eliminates PMS symptoms. However, removing the ovaries has the same effects as menopause , including increasing the risk of osteoporosis and other problems associated with menopause . To lessen or prevent some of these effects, doctors typically suggest that these women take hormone therapy that contains estrogen and a progestin or progesterone until they reach the average age for menopause (about age 51).",,
896,0,"Overview of Psychosocial Problems in Adolescents
 
 Psychologic and social problems, particularly involving behavior and school issues, are more common during adolescence than at any other time during childhood. Adolescents are much more independent and mobile and are often out of the direct control of adults. When misbehavior becomes severe and frequent, adolescents should be evaluated for a psychosocial disorder by a mental health professional. In particular, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders are common during adolescence. Adolescents who have anxiety or mood disorders may have physical symptoms such as fatigue or chronic fatigue, dizziness, headache, and abdominal or chest pain.
 
 Depression is common among adolescents, and doctors actively screen for it during examinations.
 
 Suicide is rare, but thoughts about suicide (called suicidal ideation) are more common. Suicidal ideation requires an immediate mental health evaluation; parents should not be expected to determine how ""serious"" the problem is on their own.
 
 Anxiety often manifests during adolescence, as do mood disorders and disruptive behavioral disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder.
 
 Thought disorders, in which a person has difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality (also called psychosis), most commonly begin during adolescence or early adulthood. The first episode of psychosis is called a psychotic break. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are examples of thought disorders. Periods of psychosis may be related to drug use. In these cases, psychosis may resolve after a period of time. Psychotic episodes may occur with marijuana, particularly edible products. Some adolescents who have a psychotic episode caused by marijuana use go on to develop a chronic psychotic disorder.
 
 Eating disorders, especially in girls, are common and can be life threatening. Some adolescents go to extraordinary lengths to hide symptoms of an eating disorder, which may include substantial reductions in food intake, purging after eating, use of laxatives, or extensive, vigorous exercise.
 
 Doctors can often identify these problems. They can offer adolescents practical advice and, when appropriate, encourage adolescents to accept treatment provided by specialists.

897,0,"Effects of Life Transitions on Older People
 
 Late life is commonly a period of transitions (for example, retirement or relocation) and adjustment to losses.
 
 Retirement
 
 Retirement is often the first major transition faced by older people. Its effects on physical and mental health differ from person to person, depending on attitude toward and reason for retiring. About one third of retirees have difficulty adjusting to certain aspects of retirement, such as reduced income and altered social role and entitlements. Some people choose to retire, having looked forward to quitting work. Others are forced to retire (for example, because of health problems or job loss). Appropriate preparation for retirement and counseling for retirees and families who experience difficulties may help. Many employers and community agencies offer retirement planning services.
 
 Did You Know...
 
 Many employers and community agencies offer retirement planning services.
 
 Relocation
 
 Relocation may occur several times during old age. For example, people may move to retirement housing with desirable amenities, to smaller quarters to reduce the burden of property upkeep, to a different community for better weather or to be close to family members, to a relative's home, or to a residential care facility. People who respond poorly to relocation are more likely to be living alone, socially isolated, poor, and depressed. Men often respond less well than women.
 
 Because of financial, social, and other complications, some older adults feel they must remain in problematic homes or neighborhoods despite the desire to relocate. Often, older adults may find that social workers can assist them in assessing their options for relocation or home modification.
 
 Much of the stress seems to arise when people feel they lack control over the move and do not know what to expect in the new environment. For older people who have memory loss, a move away from familiar surroundings may intensify confusion and dependence on others and lead to frustration. Many moves happen suddenly, but even a little preparation can help decrease the stress of relocating. People who are moving should be acquainted with the new setting well in advance, if possible. Touring future surroundings and meeting potential neighbors can be very helpful.
 
 Bereavement, depression, and suicide risk
 
 Bereavement affects many aspects of an older person's life. For example, social interaction and companionship decrease, and social status and financial circumstances may change. Older people may experience a decline in their own health after the death of a close family member or friend. The death of a spouse affects men and women differently. In the 2 years after death of a wife, the mortality rate in men tends to increase, especially if the wife's death was unexpected. For women who lose a husband, data are less clear but generally do not indicate an increased mortality rate.
 
 Some sleep disturbance and anxiety are normal in people who are grieving. These effects usually resolve in months without drug treatment. If grief is prolonged or overwhelming, if people become unable or unwilling to carry out even essential daily activities, or if they speak of suicide , evaluation and treatment by a doctor are necessary. If the doctor diagnoses depression , people may be referred to a mental health practitioner. At times, antidepressant drugs may be helpful.
 
 Screening for depression is an important part of a doctor visit. Caregivers and health care practitioners should look for symptoms of depression and be aware that bereaved people are at high risk of suicide and declining health. Older adults make up 13% of the population but account for 20% of all suicides, and the rate of suicide among older men is 5.25 times higher than among older women. Older adults often do not give warnings about suicide and seldom seek mental health treatment. Doctors are less likely to offer treatment for depression to older patients than to younger patients. Although older adults attempt suicide less often than those in other age groups, they have a much higher completion rate due to high likelihood of using firearms in the attempt (used in 71.3% of completed suicides among older adults) as well as more health problems and frailty, avoiding interventions, and lower likelihood of living with others who might detect and respond to suicide attempts. Thus, the risk of suicide completion among older adults with suicidal ideation is very high.
 
 Timely screening for depression and suicidal ideation is essential. Older people may need counseling and supportive services (for example, support groups for widows), as well as drugs for anxiety or depression, to help with difficult transitions.",,
898,1,"Domestic Violence
 
 Domestic violence is physical, sexual, or psychologic abuse between people who live together. It includes intimate partner violence, which refers to physical, sexual, or psychologic abuse by a current or former sex partner or spouse.
 
 The victim is usually a woman but may be a man.
 
 Physical injuries, psychologic problems, social isolation, loss of a job, financial difficulties, and even death can result.
 
 Doctors may suspect domestic violence based on injuries, inconsistent or puzzling symptoms, or the behavior of the victim and/or the victim's partner.
 
 Keeping safe—for example, having a plan of escape—is the most important consideration.
 
 Domestic violence can occur between parents and children, children and grandparents, and siblings, as well as intimate partners. It occurs among people of all cultures, races, sexual orientations, occupations, income levels, educational levels, religious backgrounds, and ages.
 
 Women are more commonly victims of domestic violence than are men. About 95% of people who seek medical attention as a result of domestic violence are women.
 
 In the United States, domestic violence was reported at some point in their life by the following groups:
 
 About 35% of heterosexual women
 
 Almost 44% of homosexual women
 
 Almost 61% of bisexual women
 
 About 29% of heterosexual men
 
 About 26% of homosexual men
 
 About 37% of bisexual men
 
 More than 21% of women and almost 15% of men in the United States have experienced severe physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner during their lifetime. Women are more likely to be severely assaulted or killed by a male partner than by anyone else. Each year in the United States, experts estimate that about 2 million women are severely beaten by their partner.
 
 Did You Know...
 
 Domestic violence can happen to anyone.
 
 In the United States, more than 21% of women and almost 15% of men have experienced severe physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner during their lifetime.
 
 The abusing partner may try to control the victim by limiting the victim's access to money and to other people, even by telephone or e-mail.
 
 Physical abuse
 
 Physical abuse is the most obvious form of domestic violence. It may include hitting, slapping, kicking, punching, breaking bones, pulling hair, pushing, twisting arms, slamming against something, choking, suffocating, beating, and burning. The victim may be deprived of food or sleep. Weapons, such as a gun or knife, may be used to threaten or cause injury.
 
 Sexual assault
 
 Sexual assault is also common. Many women who are physically assaulted by their partner are also sexually assaulted by their partner. Sexual assault involves the use of threats or force to coerce sexual contact and includes unwanted touching, grabbing, kissing, and rape .
 
 Psychologic abuse
 
 Psychologic abuse is very common and often accompanies physical or sexual abuse. Psychologic abuse involves any nonphysical behavior that undermines or belittles the victim or that enables the perpetrator to control the victim. Psychologic abuse can include
 
 Abusive language
 
 Social isolation
 
 Financial control
 
 Usually, the perpetrator uses language to demean, degrade, humiliate, intimidate, or threaten the victim in private or in public. The perpetrator may make the victim think that her perceptions of reality are wrong and that she is crazy (called gaslighting) or make her feel guilty or responsible, blaming her for the abusive relationship. The perpetrator may also humiliate the victim in terms of her sexual performance, physical appearance, or both.
 
 The perpetrator may try to partly or completely isolate the victim by controlling the victim’s access to friends, relatives, and other people. Control may include forbidding contact with others—directly or through writing, telephone, e-mail, texting, or social media. The perpetrator may use jealousy to justify his actions. The perpetrator may further isolate the victim by convincing her that family members and friends cannot or will not help her.
 
 Often, the perpetrator withholds money to control the victim. The victim may depend on the perpetrator for money (most or all). The perpetrator may maintain control by preventing the victim from getting a job, by keeping information about their finances secret, and by taking money from the victim.
 
 The perpetrator may also prevent the victim from getting medical care.
 
 Abuse using technology
 
 Perpetrators may use technology (such as social media) to post videos of, stalk, monitor, isolate, punish, threaten, and/or humiliate the victim. Also, perpetrators often monitor the victim's devices, often without the victim's knowing it.
 
 The perpetrator's behavior after abuse
 
 After an incident of abuse, the perpetrator may beg for forgiveness and promise to change and stop the abusive behavior. However, typically, the abuse continues and often escalates.
 
 The perpetrator's outbursts of violence tend to be episodic and unpredictable. Thus, victims may live in near-constant fear of the next outburst.
 
 Reasons victims remain in an abusive relationship
 
 Often, victims do not leave the abusive relationship. Reasons may include
 
 Feeling dependent on the perpetrator for money
 
 Feeling alone, with no one to help
 
 Being afraid that planning or trying to leave will trigger more intense violence
 
 Being afraid of what the perpetrator will do after they leave (for example, stalk them or hurt their children, another family member, or a pet)
 
 Believing that the abuser will change (for example, because of promises to do so)
 
 Still loving the abuser
 
 Believing that abuse may be normal (for example, because of upbringing or culture)
 
 Effects of Domestic Violence
 
 Victims of domestic violence may be physically injured. Physical injuries can include bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches, broken bones, lost teeth, and burns. Injuries may prevent victims from going to work regularly, causing them to lose their job. Injuries, as well as the abusive situation, may cause embarrassment, causing victims to isolate themselves from family and friends.
 
 Victims may develop symptoms that have no obvious physical cause. These symptoms can include headaches, abdominal or pelvic pain, and fatigue.
 
 Many victims also get sexually transmitted diseases and have problems during pregnancy.
 
 Victims may have to move often—a financial burden—to escape the perpetrator.
 
 Sometimes the perpetrator kills the victim.
 
 Did You Know...
 
 Victims of domestic violence may develop depression, anxiety, or drug or alcohol abuse.
 
 They are in greatest danger of serious harm after their partner knows they have decided to leave.
 
 As a result of domestic violence, many victims have psychologic problems. For example, more than 50% have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or depression . They may also develop anxiety disorders , eating disorders and/or substance abuse . Domestic violence may also worsen symptoms of preexisting mental disorders.
 
 Even when physical abuse decreases, psychologic abuse often continues, reminding victims that they can be physically abused at any time. Psychologic abuse can be more damaging than physical abuse. Psychologic abuse increases the risk of depression and substance abuse.
 
 Children Who Witness Domestic Violence
 
 Children Who Witness Domestic Violence
 
 Each year, millions of children are estimated to witness physical or verbal abuse in their homes.
 
 These children may develop problems such as
 
 Excessive anxiety or crying
 
 Fearfulness
 
 Difficulty sleeping
 
 Depression
 
 Social withdrawal
 
 Difficulty in school
 
 Also, children may blame themselves for the situation. Older children may run away from home.
 
 Boys who see their father abuse their mother may be more likely to become abusive adults. Girls who see their father abuse their mother may be more likely to tolerate abuse as adults.
 
 The perpetrator may also physically hurt the children. In homes where domestic violence is present, children are much more likely to be physically mistreated.
 
 Evaluation
 
 A doctor's evaluation
 
 Doctors may suspect domestic violence based on injuries, inconsistent or puzzling symptoms, and/or the behavior of the victim and/or partner. Or a victim may report the abuse.
 
 If doctors suspect domestic violence, they may gently ask the person questions about the relationship with the partner. Many experts recommend that health care practitioners ask all people questions about domestic violence.
 
 If domestic violence is suspected, doctors try to determine whether the victim can safely return home before leaving the office. Safety is in doubt in the following circumstances:
 
 The victim has threatened to leave the relationship.
 
 Violence has been increasing.
 
 The partner has access to weapons.
 
 The partner has threatened to kill or injure the victim.
 
 If domestic violence is confirmed, doctors are required to document the evidence of abuse, often by photographing the injuries. This documentation can be used to support a legal case against the perpetrator.
 
 Management
 
 Developing a safety plan
 
 Seeking help when needed
 
 Abuse is never justified. Support is available whether victims decide to stay in or leave the abusive relationship.
 
 In cases of domestic violence, the most important consideration is safety. If possible, during a violent incident, victims should try to move away from areas in which they can be trapped or in which the perpetrator can obtain weapons, such as knives in the kitchen. If possible, victims should promptly call 911 or the police and leave the residence.
 
 Victims should have any injuries treated and documented with photographs. Victims should teach their children not to get in the middle of a fight and when and how to call for help.
 
 Developing a safety plan is extremely important. It should include
 
 Where to go for help (victims should have several possible places to go and people who can be called)
 
 How to get away (often including appearing to do a routine task that involves leaving the house, such as going on an errand or walking the dog)
 
 How to access money (including hiding money away and obtaining a separate bank account and, if possible, credit card)
 
 Victims should also make and hide copies of official documents (such as children’s birth certificates, social security cards, insurance cards, and bank account numbers). They should keep an overnight bag packed and hidden in case they need to leave quickly.
 
 Sometimes the only solution is to leave the abusive relationship permanently because domestic violence tends to continue, especially among very aggressive perpetrators. Also, even when physical abuse decreases, psychologic abuse may persist.
 
 The decision to leave is not simple or easy. Often, victims feel unable to leave an abusive relationship for many reasons, including being afraid of what the perpetrator will do after they leave and being dependent on the perpetrator for money.
 
 After the perpetrator knows the victim has decided to leave, the victim’s risk of serious harm and death may be greatest. At this time, victims should take additional steps to protect themselves and their children. For example, they can obtain a restraining or protection order, although such an order does not guarantee safety.
 
 Help is available through shelters for battered women, support groups, the courts, and a national hotline (1-800-799-SAFE or, for TTY, 1-800-787-3224). The National Domestic Violence Helpline also has chat options if the victim is unable to speak safely. Victims should seek such help even if abuse is not severe. Seeking such help does not necessarily cause trouble for the partner. Information about using technology safely is available online.",,

 Approaches to Psychotherapy
 
 Choosing a Technique and Therapist
 
 There are many different types of therapy to treat depression and other mood disorders. Psychotherapy can be an effective form of treatment for depression because it can help you delve into possible underlying reasons for your depressive feelings and learn new skills to cope.
 
 Finding out which type of psychotherapy is best for you will depend on a number of factors, including the severity of your symptoms, your own personal preferences, and your therapy goals. The therapeutic modalities described below have evidence supporting their benefits as treatments for depression.
 
 What Is Psychotherapy?
 
 Psychotherapy is often called ""talk therapy"" because it involves an individual and a psychotherapist sitting in a room together talking. But it is so much more than that. Psychotherapists have formal training in a variety of techniques that they employ to help people recover from mental illness, resolve personal issues, and create positive changes in their lives.
 
 Several studies suggest, however, that the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy is the best approach, because of the complex mix of causes of mood disorders like depression.1",,

 Sleep Hygiene
 
 Dealing with sleep disturbances when you’re feeling depressed can seem like a vicious circle. The more depressed you feel, the harder it is to sleep. And the more exhausted you feel, the harder it is to fight depression.
 
 It can feel like there’s no way to break the cycle. And it’s frustrating to feel tired yet be unable to fall or stay asleep. Here's what you should know about the relationship between sleep disturbances and depression.
 
 The Link Between Sleep Disturbances and Depression
 
 Approximately 80% of people with depression experience sleep disturbances. While some have trouble falling asleep, others have difficulty staying asleep. And some find themselves sleeping too much.
 
 Both depression and insomnia involve chemicals in the brain. Changes in neurotransmitters and hormonal imbalances may affect both sleep and mood.
 
 For many years, researchers studied which came first: depression or insomnia. It was clear that the two issues often go hand-in-hand and exacerbate one another.
 
 Studies show that sleep disturbances often occur before depression begins.1",,

 By some estimates, roughly 4 billion1 people across the world use networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This usage has prompted mental health experts to investigate whether the enormous popularity of social media plays a role in depression.
 
 Research suggests that people who limit their time on social media tend to be happier than those who don’t. Studies also indicate that social media may trigger an array of negative emotions in users that contribute to or worsen their depression symptoms.
 
 Defining Depression
 
 Clinical depression or major depressive disorder is a mood disorder characterized by ongoing feelings of sadness and loss of interest in activities that an individual once enjoyed. Depression can be mild or severe and make it difficult for those with the condition to concentrate, sleep or eat well, make decisions, or complete their normal routines.
 
 People with depression may contemplate death or suicide, feel worthless, develop anxiety or have physical symptoms such as fatigue or headaches. Psychotherapy and medication are some of the treatments for depression. Limiting time on social media and prioritizing real-world connections can be beneficial to mental health.
 
 The Facts on Social Media and Depression
 
 Social media has never been more popular, with more than half of the world's population active on these networking sites that roll out nonstop news, much of it negative.
 
 A Lancet study publbished in 2018 found that people who check Facebook late at night were more likely to feel depressed and unhappy.2
 
 Another 2018 study found that the less time people spend on social media, the less symptoms of depression and loneliness they felt.3
 
 A 2015 study found that Facebook users who felt envy while on the networking site were more likely to develop symptoms of depression.4
 
 Causation or Correlation?
 
 Some studies about social media and mental health reveal that there’s a correlation between networking sites and depression. Other research goes a step further, finding that social media may very well cause depression. A landmark study—“No More FOMO: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness and Depression”—was published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology in 2018.3
 
 The study found that the less people used social media, the less depressed and lonely they felt.
 
 This indicates a relationship between lower social media use and emotional wellbeing. According to the researchers, the study marked the first time scientific research established a causal link between these variables.
 
 “Prior to this, all we could say was that there is an association between using social media and having poor outcomes with wellbeing,” said study coauthor Jordyn Young in a statement.
 
 To establish the link between social media and depression, the researchers assigned 143 University of Pennsylvania students to two groups: one could use social media with no restrictions, while the second group had their social media access limited to just 30 minutes on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat combined over a three-week period.3
 
 Each study participant used iPhones to access social media and the researchers monitored their phone data to ensure compliance. The group with restricted social media access reported lower severity of depression and loneliness than they had at the beginning of the study.
 
 Both groups reported a drop in anxiety and fear of missing out (FOMO), apparently because joining the study made even the group with unrestricted access to social media more cognizant of how much time they were spending on it.
 
 Less Social Media, Less FOMO 
 
 It’s not certain why participants who only spent 30 minutes daily on social media experienced less depression, but researchers suggest that these young people were spared from looking at content—such as a friend’s beach vacation, grad school acceptance letter, or happy family—that might make them feel bad about themselves.
 
 Taking in the photos or posts of people with seemingly “perfect” lives can make social media users feel like they just don’t measure up. A 2015 University of Missouri study found that regular Facebook users were more likely to develop depression if they felt feelings of envy on the networking site.4
 
 Social media can also give users a case of FOMO, for example, if they were invited on their friend’s beach vacation but couldn’t go for some reason. Or if the friend didn’t ask them on the trip at all, users might feel hurt and left out to see that others in their social circle were. It can lead them to question their friendships or their own self-worth.
 
 Social media users who visit an ex’s social media page and see pictures of their former partner wining and dining a new love interest can also experience FOMO. They might wonder why their ex never took them to such fancy restaurants or lavished them with gifts.
 
 Ultimately, limiting one’s time on social media can mean less time spent comparing oneself to others. This can extend to not thinking badly of oneself and developing the symptoms that contribute to depression.
 
 Why Young People Are at Risk
 
 Prior to social media and the internet, children only had to worry about bullying on school grounds, for the most part. But social media has given bullies a new way to torment their victims.
 
 With just one click, bullies can circulate a video of their target being ridiculed, beaten up, or otherwise humiliated. People can swarm a peer’s social media page, leaving negative comments or spreading misinformation. In some cases, victims of bullying have committed suicide.5
 
 While many schools have anti-bullying policies and rules about online student conduct, it can still be difficult for educators and parents to monitor abusive behavior on social media.
 
 Worsening matters is that the victims of bullies often fear that the bullying will increase if they speak to a parent, teacher, or administrator about their mistreatment. This can make a child feel even more isolated and go without the emotional support they need to handle a toxic and potentially volatile situation. 
 
 If you or someone you care about is having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.

 Bad News and ‘Doomscrolling’ 
 
 One in five Americans now get their news from social media—a larger proportion than those who get their news from traditional print media.6
 
 For heavy social media users, people who log in for multiple hours at a time or multiple times a day, this means frequent exposure news, including bad news. Headlines related to natural disasters, terrorist attacks, political strife, and celebrity deaths frequently top lists of social media trends.
 
 Before the advent of social media and the internet generally, one’s exposure to bad news was limited. The public got news from broadcasts that aired at certain times of the day or from newspapers.
 
 The habit of binging bad news on social media sites or elsewhere online is known as “doomscrolling,” and it can adversely affect one’s mental health, leading to development or heightening of anxiety or depression symptoms. 
 
 A 2018 Lancet Psychiatry study of 91,005 people found that those who logged onto Facebook before bedtime were 6% likelier to have major depressive disorder and rated their happiness level 9% lower than those with better sleep hygiene did.2
 
 Psychologist Amelia Aldao told NPR that doomscrolling locks the public into a “vicious cycle of negativity.” The cycle continues because “our minds are wired to look out for threats,” she said. “The more time we spend scrolling, the more we find those dangers, the more we get sucked into them, the more anxious we get.” Before long, the world appears to be an altogether gloomy place, making doomscrollers feel increasingly hopeless.7
 
 Safely Using Social Media
 
 Using social media comes with mental health risks, but that doesn’t mean it should be completely avoided. Experts recommend using these networking websites in moderation.
 
 Set a timer when you’re on social media or install an app on your phone or computer that tracks how long you’ve spent on a networking site.
 
 Without these timers or apps, it’s easy to spend hours on social media before you know it. To limit your time on social media, you can also plan real-world activities that help you focus on your immediate surroundings and circumstances. Read a book, watch a movie, go for a stroll, play a game, bake some bread, or have a phone conversation with a friend. Make the time to enjoy life offline.

 Although researchers don’t have an exact answer as to why some people are more prone to depression than others, there's likely more than one causative factor. Research has implicated everything from physical and chemical differences in the brain to social and environmental risk factors.1",,

 What Is Moderate Depression?
 
 While everyone feels down from time to time, depression can be a serious mental health condition that can make it difficult to function normally. Depression can vary in intensity. How depression is experienced can vary from one person to the next, and the condition can also be classified as either mild, moderate, or severe. One survey found that among U.S. adults with depression, approximately 20% had mild symptoms, 50% had moderate symptoms, and 30% had severe symptoms.1
 
 When a major depressive disorder is diagnosed, it is typically classified by the degree of severity (mild, moderate, or severe) as well as whether or not there are psychotic features and/or a seasonal pattern. Moderate depression is marked by symptoms of depression that can affect a person’s ability to function normally. It may differ from mild depression in terms of severity and frequency of symptoms that a person experiences.
 
 Someone with moderate depression may experience symptoms that are more serious in terms of severity and duration than someone with mild depression. They may also experience more symptoms than a person with mild depression does.
 
 However, moderate depression is not listed as a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). There is no official consensus on whether the number of symptoms is indicative of severity or whether the number of symptoms can be used to classify depression as mild, moderate, severe.
 
 Descriptions of depression severity are left to the discretion of the clinician, who may use depression rating scales to help determine the severity of the condition.

 Understanding Depression
 
 If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. 
 
 For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database.
 
 Depression can have many causes, all of which are complex and can be difficult to understand. In some cases, feelings of depression can be clearly connected to an experience in someone’s life, such as a tragic loss or a violent event. Other people may be aware they have a family history of mental illness and, as a result, may not be caught off guard by a diagnosis of depression. 
 
 However, some people become depressed and don’t know why. They may feel they do not have a “reason” to be depressed—especially if they perceive their life as being “good” or “easy” compared to others. 
 
 The pressure to explain or justify how they feel can make depression worse and may prevent people from getting necessary treatment. 
 
 The Lived Experience of Depression 
 
 A person who is in good physical health, is employed, has a safe home to live in, enough money to care for themselves and their family, supportive friends, and hobbies may struggle to comprehend why they feel persistently sad, angry, or irritable.
 
 In the absence of a clear “trigger” such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, or the loss of a job, they may feel that it doesn’t make sense for them to feel depressed.
 
 Perceptions of Depression
 
 The presence of these things in their lives may make someone feel that they have “no right” to be unhappy. If a person’s family does not have a history of depression, they may assume that means they couldn’t be genetically prone themselves.
 
 Likewise, a person may look back at their childhood and become confused and concerned if they don’t find a specific event that would “justify” the depression they are experiencing as an adult. 
 
 When they realize the people around them have not experienced depression, they may feel very alone. They may start to worry that others will think they don’t appreciate what they have if they appear sad or down. They may worry about being a burden to others—or being seen as a liability. 
 
 People with depression may be concerned about speaking up in fear of what might change at school or work, as well as in their relationships. 
 
 Concerns About Stigma
 
 They may worry that their boss won’t think of them as capable of doing their job if they know they have depression. When young people in school are depressed, they may be wrongly labeled “slackers” or told that they are not “trying hard enough.” 
 
 When a person with depression internalizes these messages, they may come to believe they are not smart or capable—and depression has a way of reinforcing those false beliefs by making someone have a low opinion of themselves. 
 
 In relationships, people with depression may not talk about their experiences because they are afraid others won’t understand. They may worry that their spouse, family, and friends will stop loving them. They may fear the people they care about will blame them for the feelings they have. 
 
 They may also be worried that their loved ones will blame themselves if they are unable to help, which can make a person who is depressed feel guilty or like a burden.
 
 Other Reasons People Hide What They Are Feeling
 
 Parents who are experiencing depression may worry about how their children or family could be affected. They may even fear that they will be seen as “unfit” parents if they admit to having feelings of depression. 
 
 The pressure to “justify” depression can be overwhelming, but remember the old saying that you “can’t judge a book by its cover.” The way someone else’s life appears to be may not show the whole truth.
 
 People who are depressed may work very hard to try to hide how they really feel. On the outside, they may look and even act as though they feel OK and that everything is fine.
 
 Whether you’re experiencing depression yourself or you care about someone who is, it can be helpful to reframe how you think about the condition. Start by focusing on the causes of depression (which are backed by facts) rather than focusing on reasons (which are subjective and relative).

 What Are Your Rights When You're Depressed?
 
 Although most people think of depression as an adult illness, children and adolescents can develop depression as well. Unfortunately, many children with depression go untreated because adults don't recognize they're depressed.  
 
 It's important for parents, teachers, and other adults to learn about childhood depression. When you understand the symptoms of depression in children and the reasons children develop it, you can intervene in a helpful manner.
 
 Symptoms
 
 Depression in children and teens often presents differently than it does in adults. Irritability and/or anger are more common signs of depression in children and teens. Additionally, young children often find it difficult to explain how they’re feeling, while teens may attempt to hide their emotional pain fearing judgment from others. 
 
 Because normal behaviors vary as children develop, it can be challenging to know if your child is going through a phase or if it’s something more serious. The first step towards helping your child battle depression is learning how to spot it.
 
 According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, common signs of depression in children and teens last longer than two weeks and include:1
 
 Changes in appetite or weight
 
 Feeling or appearing depressed, sad, tearful, or irritable
 
 Fatigue or perceived lack of energy 
 
 Feeling guilty or ashamed  
 
 Having more trouble concentrating
 
 Loss of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities
 
 Psychomotor slowing or agitation
 
 Recurrent thoughts of suicide and/or death 
 
 Sleep disturbance: Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day
 
 In addition to the above symptoms, some children have physical complaints, such as stomachaches and headaches, substance use, and poor school performance.
 
 Children are often less likely to meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for depression. As they age, symptom presentation becomes more consistent with the DSM-5 criteria.
 
 Causes
 
 While stressful life events, like divorce, may contribute to depression, it's only a small piece of the puzzle. Many other factors, including genetics, also play a role in its development. 
 
 There are a number of different factors that can contribute to childhood depression including:2
 
 Brain chemistry: Imbalances in certain neurotransmitters and hormones may play a role in how the brain works, which can affect moods and emotions and increase the risk of experiencing depression.
 
 Environmental factors: A stressful, chaotic, or unstable home environment can also make children more likely to experience depression. Rejection and bullying at school may also be a contributing factor.
 
 Family history: Children with family members who also have mood disorders such as depression are at a greater risk for also experiencing symptoms of depressive disorders.
 
 Stress or trauma: Sudden changes such as moving or divorce, or traumatic events such as abuse or assault can also contribute to feelings of depression.
 
 Anyone can develop depression, and it isn't a sign of weakness. It also isn't your fault if your child is depressed. 
 
  How Moving Can Trigger Depression in Kids
 
 Diagnosis
 
 If you think your child is showing signs of depression, schedule an appointment with your child's pediatrician to discuss your concerns.
 
 Before arriving at a diagnosis, your child will have to undergo a comprehensive physical and medical evaluation. Both will rule out any underlying medical conditions which could be contributing to the symptoms you are seeing. For example, thyroid problems, anemia, and vitamin deficiency can all mimic symptoms of depression.
 
 While there is no specific test for depression, a doctor may use one or multiple psychological assessments to further evaluate the type and severity of depression your child is experiencing.
 
 Classification of Depression
 
 When your child is diagnosed with a depressive disorder, it is typically classified by severity:
 
 Mild
 
 Moderate
 
 Severe (also called ""major"" or ""clinical"")
 
 According to the DSM-5, this classification is based on the number, type, and severity of symptoms and the degree to which they interfere with your day-to-day life.3",,

There is no ""number one cause"" of depression, and even more complex is the relationship between genetics, depression, and other known contributing factors.

 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a mood disorder that is characterized by symptoms that occur at the same time each year, usually during the darker, shorter days of fall and winter. While this condition usually resolves within a few months, it can have a serious impact on how a person feels and functions.1
 
 It is not uncommon for people to experience seasonal fluctuation in moods. You may have noticed how a gray, rainy day makes you feel gloomy and tired, while a sunny day can leave you feeling cheerful and energized.
 
 The longer, sunnier days of summer are often associated with better moods, while the shorter, darker days that begin in late fall often align with an increase in SAD symptoms.
 
 Symptoms
 
 The symptoms of SAD occur cyclically with a return of symptoms each year during the winter months. Symptoms can include:2
 
 Depression
 
 Fatigue
 
 Social withdrawal
 
 Increased sleep
 
 Increased appetite and carbohydrate cravings
 
 Weight gain
 
 Irritability
 
 Interpersonal difficulties (especially rejection sensitivity)
 
 A heavy, leaden feeling in the arms or legs
 
 Causes
 
 Seasonal affective disorder is believed to be caused by a disturbance in the normal circadian rhythm of the body. Sunlight entering through the eyes influences this rhythm.
 
 When it's dark, the pineal gland produces a substance called melatonin which is responsible for the drowsiness we feel each day after dusk. Light entering the eyes at dawn shuts off the production of melatonin.
 
 Insufficient exposure to sunlight has been associated with low levels of melatonin and serotonin, carbohydrate craving, weight gain, and sleep disturbance.
 
 During the shorter days of winter, when people may rise before dawn or not leave their offices until after sunset, these normal rhythms may become disrupted, producing the symptoms of SAD.
 
 There is also evidence linking SAD to a reduced amount of the neurotransmitter serotonin.3 Serotonin is the feel-good substance that is increased by antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
 
 Diagnosis
 
 There is no laboratory test for SAD. It is diagnosed based upon a person's symptom history using criteria set forth by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).
 
 The DSM-5 does not consider SAD to be a separate disorder. Instead, it is a “specifier” of a major depressive episode diagnosis. In order to be diagnosed with SAD a person must, first of all, meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.
 
 At least five of the symptoms listed below must be present most of the time during a two-week period. Further, at least one of the person's symptoms must be one of the first two items listed.
 
 A depressed mood that is due to a medical condition or that is related to the content of a delusion or hallucination that the person is experiencing would not count.
 
 Feelings of depression
 
 Loss of interest in things once enjoyed
 
 Changes in appetite or weight not associated with intentional dietary changes for the purpose of gaining or losing weight
 
 Sleeping too much or too little
 
 Psychomotor agitation or retardation
 
 Fatigue or lost energy
 
 Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
 
 Problems with concentration, thought, or decision-making
 
 Thoughts of death or suicide 
 
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.
 
 For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database.
 
 Any symptoms that could be better explained by their connection to a medical condition, substance use, or grief would not count toward a depression diagnosis. In addition, a psychotic disorder, such as schizoaffective disorder, would have to be ruled out as a cause for the symptoms.
 
 If these criteria fit, the following criteria would also need to be met to obtain a seasonal pattern specifier:
 
 A seasonal pattern of onset and cessation in major depressive episodes
 
 Two major depressive episodes meeting all of the above criteria for the past two years without any episodes of major depression have occurred at other times of the year
 
 A lifetime pattern of having mainly seasonally-related major depressive episodes

 Seasonal affective therapy responds well to treatment. The most commonly used treatments for SAD include light therapy, medication, and psychotherapy.
 
 Light Therapy
 
 Light therapy using a device that gives off bright, white light is considered the best form of treatment for SAD at this time. In fall 1998, a group of 13 Canadian specialists issued a set of professional consensus guidelines for the treatment of SAD.4 Among their conclusions:
 
 The starting ""dose"" for light therapy using a fluorescent lightbox is 10,000 lux for 30 minutes per day. (Alternatively, lightboxes emitting 2,500 lux require two hours of exposure per day.)
 
 Light therapy should be started in the early morning, upon awakening, to maximize treatment response.
 
 Response to light therapy often occurs within one week, but some patients may require up to four weeks to show a response.
 
 Common side effects of light therapy include headache, eyestrain, nausea, and agitation, but these effects are generally mild and transient or disappear with reducing the dose of light.
 
 According to Dr. Michael Terman, head of the Winter Depression Program at Columbia-Presbyterian University, the consensus in the United States is that post-awakening bright light therapy, using a broad-spectrum white light source at 10,000 lux, is the first-line intervention.5
 
 Drugs should be brought in as adjuvants only if light therapy is insufficient.
 
 Optimum dosing of light is crucial since if done wrong it can produce no improvement, partial improvement, or even worsening of symptoms.
 
  Buying the Right Light Box for Seasonal Affective Disorder
 
 In a study published in the Archives of General Psychiatry researchers exposed participants with SAD to bright lights that were 10 to 20 times brighter than normal indoor electrical lights.6
 
 One group was exposed to these lights for approximately one and a half hours in the morning, while a second group was exposed in the evening. The third group received a placebo treatment.
 
 The participants who were exposed to the morning bright light treatments experienced full or near-full relief from depression.
 
 Newer research published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease has found that even a single, one-hour light session can rapidly improve symptoms of depression in people with SAD.7 And morning therapy, specifically, can help to correct any sleep-wake cycle issues contributing to the symptoms.
 
  The Best Light Therapy Lamps
 
 Medications
 
 On June 12, 2006, Wellbutrin XL (bupropion hydrochloride) became the first drug approved specifically for SAD in the United States.
 
 The effectiveness of Wellbutrin XL for the prevention of SAD episodes was established in three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a history of major depressive disorder in fall and winter.8
 
 Treatment began in the September through November timeframe, prior to the onset of symptoms. Treatment ended the first week of spring.
 
 In these trials, the percentage of patients who were depression-free at the end of treatment was significantly higher for those on Wellbutrin XL than for those on placebo.
 
 For all three studies combined, the overall rate of patients depression-free at the end of treatment was 84% for those on Wellbutrin XL, compared to 72% for those on placebo.
 
 Wellbutrin XL is chemically unrelated to other common antidepressant medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In fact, there is no conclusive evidence from randomized trials to support the use of SSRIs in the treatment of SAD.
 
 Psychotherapy
 
 Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can also be an effective treatment for SAD, particularly if it is used in conjunction with light therapy and medication. CBT involves identifying negative thought patterns that contribute to symptoms and then replacing these thoughts with more positive ones.

 Coping
 
 Healthy habits and lifestyle choices can also help reduce SAD symptoms. Things that you can do include:
 
 Getting regular exercise
 
 Getting enough sleep
 
 Eating a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and protein
 
 Vitamin D
 
 Research has found that people with SAD often have low vitamin D levels.9 Because of this, people with the condition are often encouraged to increase their intake of this vitamin either through diet, exposure to sunshine, or vitamin supplementation.
 
 However, research on effectiveness has been mixed. Some studies have suggested that it may be as effective as light therapy, while other studies have found no positive effect of vitamin D on SAD symptoms.10
 
 Always talk to your doctor before taking any medication, supplement, or herbal remedy to treat seasonal affective disorder.
 
 Monitor Your Symptoms
 
 Recognizing your tendency to experience seasonal depression can be helpful in aiding your treatment and coping. By knowing the signs, you'll be able to reach out to your doctor and make lifestyle changes that may help you cope more effectively sooner.
 
 The Center for Environmental Therapeutics (CET), a non-profit organization that provides educational materials about SAD, offers free, downloadable self-assessment questionnaires, as well as interpretation guides, to help you determine if you should seek professional advice.
 
 Among the quizzes available are the AutoPIDS and AutoMEQ. Used together, the AutoPIDS helps you determine whether you have the symptoms of SAD and what your natural bedtime is, and the AutoSIGH tracks your current state of depression.
 
 While helpful resources, these tests should not be taken as a firm diagnosis, so be sure to discuss your results with your primary care physician or mental health professional prior to beginning any treatment.
 
 A Word From Verywell
 
 Seasonal mood shifts are common, but sometimes seasonal depression may represent a serious condition that can impact your well-being and ability to function normally.

 During the winter months, the sunrise is later and the sunset is earlier, which forces many people to commute to and from work in the dark after working in an office all day. Some people may go multiple days in a row before stepping outside into the sunshine.
 
 Living in the dark can affect everyone; even if you are a happy-go-lucky person without any past history of depression. Our vitamin D stores can be depleted in the winter and our inside time usually far outweighs our outside time.
 
 A shift in mood is not necessarily alarming unless it permeates multiple aspects of your life. 
 
 So how do we differentiate seasonal affective disorder (SAD), also commonly referred to as season depression, from the winter blues and what can we do to boost our mood during the cold-weather months?
 
 What Is the Winter Blues?
 
 Winter Blues
 
 The winter blues is a mental state comprised of feelings of sadness and fatigue during the coldest and darkest months of the year.
 
 It may be hard to get out of bed some mornings, you may have trouble sleeping and you may feel unmotivated to complete daily tasks or to get outside. However, the winter blues is temporary and does not affect your ability to function throughout the day.
 
 You may feel down and out, but you are still completing your necessary daily tasks, such as going to work and completing household duties. Winter blues is to sadness as seasonal affective disorder is to depression.
 
 Symptoms of the Winter Blues
 
 Feelings of sadness during the winter months

 Trouble sleeping

 Although winter blues is not considered a mental health disorder and does not interfere with our daily functions, it can still make us feel “down and out.""
 
 Treatment For the Winter Blues
 
 Lifestyle changes and self-care routines are key to improving your mood in the winter months.
 
 Seek Out the Sun
 
 The sun is an unlimited source of vitamin D which is essential for circadian rhythm regulation and as a result can increase our energy levels and boost our mood. If you live in a location that snows and rains during the winter, consider traveling to a sunny tropical place in the winter to reset your clock and soak up the warm rays.
 
 Adopt a Regular Sleep/Wake Routine
 
 Going to bed at the same time every night and waking up at the same time every morning can help stabilize your internal clock and allow you to wake up feeling refreshed and energized instead of feeling fatigued throughout the day.
 
 Exercise Daily
 
 Exercise releases endorphins, which are known to improve mood and energy. Exercising at least 30 minutes each day for five days a week can improve your energy levels and mood.
 
 Exercising outdoors is even better as it allows you to breathe in the fresh air, soak up the sun and enjoy nature.
 
 Eat a Balanced Diet
 
 In the winter, many of us crave sweets and complex carbohydrates, which can leave us feeling tired. Try to incorporate whole grains and fresh produce into your diet on a daily basis.
 
 Try eating foods that are rich in vitamin D such as fish, egg yolks, mushrooms and foods such as milk, juices and cereals that are fortified with vitamin D.
 
 Consider Vitamin D Supplements
 
 The recommended daily vitamin D intake is approximately 1,000 IU (25 mcg) per day. However, 40% of U.S. adults are deficient in vitamin D. Although it is best to obtain the daily dosage of vitamin D from diet and sunlight, taking daily vitamin D supplements may be the best way to improve your mood during the winter months.1",,

 Risks and Other Considerations
 
 While we all know the hazards of spending too much time in the sun—like skin cancer, sunburns, and premature aging—you might not be aware of the many vital benefits of sun exposure.
 
 From bone and immune health to depression and seasonal affective disorder (SAD), sunlight offers powerful restorative, protective, and healing effects.
 
 Overview
 
 The skin cancer awareness campaigns of the past several decades have been so successful that many people don't realize all of the good things time in the sun can do for the mind and body—or the dangers of not getting enough sunlight.
 
 Those warm, yellow rays help the body make vitamin D, an essential nutrient the body needs to function properly, and the body can't absorb or process calcium without it.
 
 Vitamin D is essential for bone, heart, lung, dental, immune, nerve, and muscular health as well as for optimal mental health.
 
 Deficiencies in vitamin D (and calcium) can cause serious conditions, such as the bone disease called rickets. Also, those with lower levels of vitamin D may be at higher risk of a range of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, schizophrenia, and depression.1",,

 If you have a mental disorder such as major depression, you may wonder what your rights are when you apply for a job or are up for a promotion.
 
 Obviously, if you had a physical disability it wouldn't be legal for an employer to discriminate against you, thanks to the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), which came into effect in 1992 to prevent private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies, and labor unions from discriminating against people with disabilities.
 
 It applies to job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, and more. Businesses or companies with 15 or more employees are required to comply with the ADA.
 
 In 2008, important changes to the ADA expanded the definition of disability, making it possible for people with ""invisible"" conditions, such as depression, to be protected, even when their symptoms are controlled by medications, lifestyle changes, or therapy.

 Melancholic depression is a form of major depressive disorder (MDD) that is characterized by a profound presentation of severe depression. With this form of depression, there is a complete loss of pleasure in all or almost everything. In the DSM-5, melancholia is a specifier for MDD, so a person would be diagnosed as having major depressive disorder (the broader illness) with melancholic features (the specific symptoms). 
 
 While melancholic depression is no longer considered a separate, distinct diagnosis, some researchers suggest that it should be considered a distinct syndrome in order to improve treatments and outcomes.1",,

 While there are many types of depressive disorders, the most common types in children are major depressive disorder (MDD), persistent depressive disorder (PDD), and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). Depressive episodes are also a key feature of bipolar disorder in children.
 
 The good news is that depressive disorders in children are treatable. If you recognize the signs and symptoms in your child, a mental health professional can work with you and your family to find the right treatment plan to reduce symptoms and increase your child's quality of life.
 
 Types of Depressive Disorders
 
 Here is a look at the different types of depressive disorders in children, along with the symptoms, causes, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and coping tips.
 
 Major Depressive Disorder
 
 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe condition in which a child experiences episodes of depression. Most teens have symptoms that last for at least two weeks.
 
 According to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), symptoms of childhood depression can include:
 
 Academic decline
 
 Withdrawal from friends and family
 
 Loss of interest in things of past enjoyment
 
 Problems with sleep
 
 Appetite and/or weight changes
 
 Feelings of guilt or being misunderstood
 
 Clinging to a parent
 
 Unexplained crying
 
 Thoughts or actions of self-harm
 
 Additionally, children with MDD may exhibit symptoms of anxiety, like shyness, fear, and unexplained physical complaints.
 
 Approximately 2% to 3% of children under age 10 meet the criteria for MDD, but between the ages of 10 and 14, the rate increases to 5% to 8% for children overall. Approximately twice as many girls will experience depression as boys by age 15. Prior to puberty, boys have a higher rate of depression than girls.
 
 Recovery rates for MDD are high for children who receive treatment. However, so are recurrent episodes of depression. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) suggests early identification and treatment of depression in children, given the short- and long-term consequences, such as poor self-esteem, substance misuse, risk-taking, poor academic performance, poor social development, and risk of suicide.
 
 Persistent Depressive Disorder
 
 Persistent depressive disorder (PDD), formerly known as dysthymia or dysthymic disorder, is a chronic but milder mood disorder than MDD. For adults, symptoms of depression must be experienced more often than not for at least two years to be diagnosed with PDD. For children, the requirement is lowered to one year.
 
 Children with PDD are more functional than children with MDD. Despite their symptoms, children with PDD can usually attend school and participate in activities that some children with MDD may not be able to. Children with PDD may have lived with depression for so long that they believe their depressed state is ""normal."" Parents or others close to the child may just think that they have a shy or introverted personality rather than a depressive disorder.
 
 Symptoms of PDD in children are similar to symptoms of MDD but less severe. The rate of PDD in children is 3%. According to a study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research in 2008, 75% of those children go on to experience MDD.1",,

 Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a childhood condition that is characterized by severe anger, irritability, and frequent temper outbursts. While temper tantrums tend to be quite common in kids, DMDD is more than just normal childhood moodiness. The angry outbursts that kids experience are extreme, intense, and can lead to significant disruption in many areas of a child's life. 
 
 This condition is a fairly new diagnosis, first appearing in the 2013 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5). This condition was added to the DSM-5 to help address concerns about possible over-diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder in children. 
 
 Some controversy exists about the addition of this condition, however, due to the lack of empirical data on DMDD. 
 
 Symptoms 
 
 In order to be diagnosed with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a child must be between the ages of six and 18. The age of onset must occur before age 10.
 
 The symptoms of DMDD include:
 
 Severe, recurrent temper tantrums. Such outbursts can involve yelling, pushing, hitting, or destruction of property.
 
 Outbursts occurring three or more times a week. A child may still be diagnosed with DMDD if they don’t always have this many outbursts a week. Kids may have more tantrums one week, and fewer the next. On average, tantrums three or more times a week are required for the diagnosis.
 
 Tantrums that are out of proportion to the situation. For example, you might expect a child to get angry when they don’t get a toy they want, but a child with DMDD might act out with physical aggression and verbal outbursts that are excessive and intense.
 
 Tantrums that are inappropriate for the child's age level. For example, while you might not be surprised if a very young child has a tantrum that involves falling to the floor crying and screaming, it is not something you would expect from a 12-year-old.
 
 Irritable and angry moods between tantrums. In between bouts of intense emotional outbursts, kids with DMDD have moods that are consistently angry and extremely irritable. Such moods are present most of the time and are noticed by others.
 
 Symptoms happen in multiple settings. This means that temper outbursts don’t just occur in a single setting, such as at school. DMDD is characterized by having such tantrums having tantrums in at least two settings such as at school, at home, or with peers.
 
 In addition to the above criteria, these symptoms must be present for at least 12 months with no more than three consecutive months where the diagnostic criteria are not met. In addition to meeting these criteria, psychiatrists will also rule out other causes such as substance use and developmental disability.
 
 How Common Is DMDD?
 
 Because this condition is so new, there is not a great deal of data available on prevalence rates. The results of one study suggest that between 0.8% and 3.3% (depending on how strictly exclusion criterion were applied) of more than 3,200 participants between the ages of 2 and 17 met the diagnostic criteria for DMDD over a three-month period.1",,

 5 Ways to Cope With Anger
 
 How to Get Help
 
 Do you find yourself wondering, “Why am I so angry?” It might be a sign that you need to find some healthy ways to manage this difficult emotion.
 
 Anger is a normal emotion that everyone experiences from time to time. There are many situations that can trigger feelings of anger, which may range in intensity from mild annoyance to profound rage.
 
 It is when anger becomes extreme, uncontrollable, or chronic that it can pose a serious problem. It can lead to stress that harms your health or even affect your relationships with other people. Because of this, it is important to understand what you can do when you are feeling angry to get your feelings under control.
 
 While anger is often connected to negative health consequences, research suggests that the use of constructive ways of managing anger is associated with a lower risk of heart disease.1
 
 5 Ways to Cope With Anger
 
 If you are experiencing anger, there are things that you can do to manage your emotions. Below is a list of some things that may help.
 
 Take Some Deep Breaths
 
 When anger strikes, it’s easy to get caught up in the heat of the moment. Your body often enters a state known as the fight-or-flight response, which helps prime your body to take action. Your heart rate increases and you begin to breathe much more rapidly.
 
 In order to take control and reduce feelings of anger, it can be helpful to focus on your breathing. Focus on taking slow, deep, controlled breaths. Rather than taking shallow breaths that only fill your chest, try taking in deeper breaths that expand your belly as well.
 
 The great thing about deep breathing is that it is something that you can use quickly in the moment whenever anger threatens to overwhelm you. It can give you time to calm yourself, take some moments to think, and respond in a way that isn't going to have long-term negative effects.2

 Postpartum depression is a form of depression that occurs after the birth of a child. While it’s often experienced by mothers, it can also be experienced by fathers.
 
 Men may not experience the pain of childbirth or need physical recovery, but the presence of a new child is a major life change. Fathers, like mothers, need to pay attention to their mental health. Exhaustion and stress, in addition to other factors, can lead to male postpartum depression. 
 
 Symptoms
 
 Feeling exhausted, overwhelmed, and stressed following the birth of a child is a normal aspect of parenthood. Still, if symptoms persist or if they interfere with daily life or the ability to care for the child, then it could be postpartum depression. This is true for both mothers and fathers.
 
 Many postpartum depression symptoms are synonymous with a major depressive disorder. Symptoms vary from person to person. You may experience some, not all, and they can vary in degree. 
 
 For men experiencing paternal depression, these are some common symptoms:
 
 A significant change in appetite 
 
 Weight change
 
 Inability to sleep
 
 Unexplained aches or pains
 
 Loss of energy
 
 Feeling restless or agitated
 
 Loss of interest or pleasure in activities 
 
 Feeling sad or hopeless
 
 Feeling worthless or guilty
 
 Excessive worrying
 
 Inability to concentrate or make decisions
 
 Sudden changes in mood
 
 Thoughts of suicide or death 
 
 Intrusive thoughts of harming the baby
 
 Irritability, indecisiveness, and a limited range of emotions are also common symptoms experienced by men with postpartum depression.1
 
 Diagnosis
 
 Women are often screened by their doctor for postpartum depression, but men typically aren’t. They are also more likely to underreport their symptoms,1 which is why postpartum depression in men can go undiagnosed and untreated.
 
 If you’re a new father experiencing persistent and ongoing symptoms of depression, you’ll want to notify your partner, doctor, and/or mental health professional. Depression doesn’t go away on its own, so the sooner you’re diagnosed, the sooner you can begin treatment and relieve symptoms.
 
 The diagnostic process may include clinical questioning, often using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), and/or the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The healthcare professional will rule out physical conditions that could cause depression or other underlying mental health conditions before making a diagnosis. 
 
 Because there's a stigma associated with men and their mental health, especially when it comes to postpartum depression, it’s important for men to speak up and seek professional help when symptoms arise and especially when those symptoms continue for an extended period of time. 
 
 Treatment
 
 Treatment for postpartum depression is similar to treatment for clinical depression. Depending on your situation and the severity of your depression, you may be prescribed medication, therapy, or a combination of both.
 
 Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used medications for postpartum depression.2 Antidepressants and other medications may also be considered for men with postpartum depression.
 
 If the medication causes unwanted side effects or if the depression worsens, you’ll want to notify your healthcare provider to make adjustments or find alternative treatment options.
 
 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are psychotherapies known to relieve symptoms of postpartum depression, but most men prefer individual or couples therapy which can help relieve symptoms.1
 
 No matter the preferred treatment, men can benefit from support groups or educational classes, especially if they’re partner is also suffering from postpartum depression or if they’re lacking support from friends, family, or community members. For best success, father-tailored models of care should be considered.3
 
 Causes
 
 Approximately 8% of fathers experience paternal depression.4 Unfortunately, many cases of postnatal depression go undiagnosed in men so early diagnosis and intervention are important for the health of the father and the family.
 
 Many factors can contribute to the development or worsening of postpartum depression, including but not limited to:
 
 History of depression or anxiety 
 
 Other mental health concerns, such as substance misuse
 
 Low or lack of social support 
 
 Low income or financial stress 
 
 Relationship with mother
 
 Postpartum depression in mother
 
 Young paternal age
 
 Living in a separate household from the child
 
 Postpartum depression can manifest differently for men than women. Extending work hours, withdrawing from the family, or losing interest in activities could all be signs that mental health support is needed. 
 
 Prognosis
 
 Postpartum depression often excludes men, even though fathers can experience the disorder and many do. When male postpartum depression goes undiagnosed, it can harm the whole family. 
 
 A father's depression can impact the child’s development and increase the child’s risk of developing a psychiatric disorder in early childhood.5 It can also cause disharmony in their relationship with the mother and in extreme cases, can lead to anger, aggression, or violent behavior.
 
 Following the birth of a child, fathers experience hormonal changes, says Hannah Tishman, LCSW at Cobb Psychotherapy, and they often feel heightened pressures related to finances and their career.
 
 The focus of the household also changes, impacting new fathers. Before having a child, the man may have been the primary focus of their partner, Tishman explains, but this changes, and the mother often bonds quickly with the child and this can make the father feel left out. Adding in lack of intimacy, lack of sleep and guilt around the inability to bond with the baby can make fathers feel worse.
 
 Fathers don’t often get the same support as mothers following the birth of a child and may experience feelings of resentment, neglect, or unreasonable gender expectations.6
 
 Like mothers, fathers need a strong support system throughout the perinatal period and in the early stages of parenthood. 
 
  Anxiety in New Fathers is Common
 
 Coping
 
 When men suffer from postpartum depression, it can impact their ability to function and properly care for their partner and child. 
 
 In addition to maintaining healthy self-care habits, which can include meditation or therapy, Tishman recommends:
 
 Exercising regularly
 
 Eating healthy foods
 
 Maintaining healthy sleep habits
 
 Talking about and expressing feelings
 
 For men, it may be difficult to ask for help, especially when their partner is going through so many changes and needs their support.
 
 While it’s important to care for your partner and child following childbirth, fathers need to recognize their own mental health needs and find healthy ways to cope with symptoms of depression. Talking to a therapist or joining a support group of other fathers can help.

 A Word From Verywell
 
 Male postpartum depression can go undiagnosed for many months or years, but it’s easily treatable. If you’re a new father experiencing symptoms of depression, talk to your primary care physician or a mental health professional. 
 
 If your loved one expresses concern over your mental health, then it’s important to seek professional help so you can better care for yourself, your partner, and your new child. ",,

 Though many people with depression lead fulfilling lives and often find treatment plans that work for them, it's important to be aware of the fatalities that do occur in those who have suffered from this mental health condition.
 
 One of the main ways that depression might lead to death is if the negative symptoms result in a person deciding to take their own life. Depression can make people feel helpless and without hope, causing them to reach the unfortunate conclusion that suicide is the only way to end their misery.
 
 Increased Risk of Suicide
 
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide was the tenth leading cause of death among all age groups in the year 2017. In 2016, there were nearly 45,000 deaths attributed to suicide in the United States.1
 
 According to some estimates, depression is present in about half of all suicides.2
 
 The other half, about 54%, of people who died by suicide did not have a known mental health condition, according to the CDC.
 
  Suicide Warning Signs and Risk Factors
 
 What to Do
 
 If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, talk to your doctor or mental health professional. They can recommend treatment options, such as antidepressants and talk therapy, both of which can relieve symptoms and help you feel better.

 Self-Medicating
 
 Depression can also lead some individuals to turn to drugs and or alcohol to self-medicate emotional problems. This can occur more often when people are unable to deal or cope with painful feelings of sadness, isolation, anger, hopelessness, and stress.
 
 When a person has depression and they develop an unhealthy dependency on these substances, it is known as a dual diagnosis, since there is an issue of depression and an issue of a substance use disorder.
 
 Dual diagnosis complicates the treatment of depression, since both conditions must be dealt with as separate, yet interconnected, issues. 
 
 The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that one in four deaths in America can be blamed on alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drug use.3 In addition, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration states that substance misuse is one of the biggest risk factors for suicide.4
 
 What to Do
 
 If you have symptoms of depression and substance misuse, it is important to talk to your doctor about your feelings and behaviors. An appropriate diagnosis can help ensure that you get the right treatment to address each condition.
 
 Short-term treatments involve quitting any substances you might be using. Your doctor can make recommendations about the detox and withdrawal process. Depending on the substance in question and the frequency and duration of use, your doctor may recommend inpatient residential treatment or outpatient options to assist during this process.
 
 In some cases, you may be able to go through this process at home, but you should always talk to your doctor first. Drug withdrawal can be life-threatening in some cases and requires professional intervention and medical monitoring.
 
 Long-term treatments of dual-diagnosis issues may involve the use of antidepressants, psychotherapy, and other medications to address symptoms of depression and include:
 
 Behavioral counseling
 
 Cognitive-behavioral therapy
 
 Contingency management
 
 Group therapy
 
 Medications to aid in recovery
 
 Support groups

 Chronic illness can also increase the risk of depression.

Some health conditions, such as stroke and Parkinson's disease, can also cause changes in the brain that contribute to depression.5",,

 New Year's Eve can be a difficult holiday to spend alone. It's a day that most people spend with significant others, loved ones, or friends, and is usually associated with festive parties and celebrations surrounded by many people.
 
 If you experience social anxiety or are living with social anxiety disorder (SAD), your emotional stress and physical symptoms like muscle tension and a rapid heartbeat may feel heightened during social holidays like New Year's Eve. But just because you're ringing in the new year your own way doesn't mean you have to suffer.
 
 Whether you're spending New Year's Eve alone because of social anxiety, because you're far away from friends and family, or anything in between, here are 10 ways to prevent yourself from feeling down.
 
 Reframe Negative Thoughts
 
 For some people, dwelling on being solo during New Year's Eve is inevitable. But you can use this time as an opportunity to try a cognitive behavioral therapy technique. When a negative thought pops into your head, identify it, evaluate it, then flip it to something positive.
 
 For example, although you're solo this New Year's Eve, that doesn't mean you'll be alone next year. And while you might feel like the only one without someone to celebrate with, remember that many others are in your situation. This mental shift can be an effective way to cope with social anxiety.1",,

Some people live far from family and miss seeing their loved ones this time of year; others dread going to holiday parties and New Year’s Eve celebrations and end up staying home. Even those with an abundance of friends and family nearby may feel more lonely this year with restrictions on travel and gatherings due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
 
 It’s also common for people to feel emotional distance from the people they’re with, which can result in feeling lonely even when in a room full of people.

 How to Spend Time Alone
 
 Creating Space to Be Alone
 
 People tend to be social creatures and research has shown that social connections are vital for both emotional and physical well-being. However, alone time also plays a pivotal role in mental health. Being around other people comes with rewards, but it also creates stress. You worry about what people think. You alter your behavior to avoid rejection and to fit in with the rest of the group. 
 
 While it may be the cost of being part of a social world, some of these challenges demonstrate why alone time can be so important. Having time for yourself gives you the chance to break free from social pressures and tap into your own thoughts, feelings, and experiences.
 
 Why Alone Time Is Important
 
 Finding time to be alone can have a number of key benefits. Some of these include:
 
 Personal exploration
 
 Creativity
 
 Social energy
 
 Personal Exploration
 
 Becoming comfortable in your own company can give you the time and freedom to truly explore your own passions without interference. It can be a way to try new things, research topics that fascinate you, acquire knowledge, and even practice new methods of self-expression.
 
 Giving yourself alone time means you can explore these things without the pressures and judgments that others may impose. Having time to yourself is critical for growth and personal development. Instead of worrying about the needs, interests, and opinions that others may have, alone time lets you focus on yourself.
 
 Creativity
 
 Alone time is an opportunity to let your mind wander and strengthen your creativity. Without the need to care for or interact with other people, you can ignore outside influences and focus inward.
 
 Research actually suggests that being alone can lead to changes in the brain that help fuel the creative process. One study found that people who tend to purposely withdraw in order to spend time alone also tend to be highly creative people.1",,

 Virtually everyone experiences loneliness from time to time. The feeling can be especially noticeable around the holidays, Valentine's Day, and times of extreme stress.
 
 The sheer number of adults in the United States who feel lonely is quite large—in a January 2020 survey of 10,000 adults by Cigna, 61% of those surveyed said they felt lonely.1 However, people don’t always talk about feelings of loneliness and don’t always know what to do with these feelings.
 
 Other than being emotionally painful, loneliness can impact people in many ways:
 
 Depression: A 2021 study published in Lancet Psychiatry found associations between loneliness and depressive symptoms in a group of adults 50 years old and older.2 Research also suggests that loneliness and depression may feed off of and perpetuate each other.3
 
 Physical health: Several studies have linked emotional stress with depressed immunity.4 Other research links loneliness and depression with poorer health and well-being.5 Therefore, people who are experiencing loneliness are susceptible to a variety of health issues.
 
 Physical pain: Research shows that the areas of the brain that deal with social exclusion are the same areas that process physical pain, adding a scientific explanation to the oft-romanticized experience of a ""broken heart.""6
 
 If you’re experiencing loneliness, there are some things you can do about it. Below are nine strategies for how to deal with being lonely.
 
 Join a Class or Club
 
 Whether it’s an art class, exercise class, or book club, joining a class or a club automatically exposes you to a group of people who share at least one of your interests. Check your local library or community college as well as city parks and recreation departments to see what's available.
 
 Joining a class or club can also provide a sense of belonging that comes with being part of a group. This can stimulate creativity, give you something to look forward to during the day, and help stave off loneliness.
 
 Volunteer
 
 Volunteering for a cause you believe in can provide the same benefits as taking a class or joining a club: meeting others, being part of a group, and creating new experiences. It also brings the benefits of altruism and can help you find more meaning in your life.
 
 In addition to decreasing loneliness, this can bring greater happiness and life satisfaction. Additionally, working with those who have less than you can help you feel a deeper sense of gratitude for what you have in your own life.
 
  Why Being Good to Others Is Also Benefits You
 
 Find Support Online
 
 Because loneliness is a somewhat widespread issue, there are many people online who are looking for people to connect with. Find people with similar interests by joining Facebook or Meetup groups focused on your passions. Check to see if any apps you use, like fitness or workout apps, have a social element or discussion board to join.
 
 You do have to be careful of who you meet over the internet (and, obviously, don’t give out any personal information like your bank account number), but you can find real support, connection, and lasting friendships from people you meet online.
 
 A word of caution: Social media can actually increase feelings of loneliness and cause FOMO, or ""fear of missing out"" so be sure to check in with yourself if you're starting to feel this way.
 
 Strengthen Existing Relationships
 
 You probably already have people in your life that you could get to know better or connections with family that could be deepened. If so, why not call friends more often, go out with them more, and find other ways to enjoy your existing relationships and strengthen bonds?
 
 If you're struggling to find the motivation to reach out to your loved ones, it might be helpful to start slowly. Come up with just one supportive friend or family member who you could imagine reaching out to. It's also reassuring to know that strong social support is beneficial for your mental health.
 
 Adopt a Pet
 
 Pets, especially dogs and cats, offer so many benefits, and preventing loneliness is one of them. Rescuing a pet combines the benefits of altruism and companionship, and fights loneliness in several ways.
 
 It can connect you with other people—walking a dog opens you up to a community of other dog-walkers, and a cute dog on a leash tends to be a people magnet. Additionally, pets provide unconditional love, which can be a great salve for loneliness.
 
  How Having a Pet Affects Your Stress Levels
 
 Talk to Strangers
 
 An easy way to find connections in everyday life is by interacting in small ways with acquaintances or strangers you encounter. In fact, research shows that doing so contributes to our social and emotional well-being.7 So next time you grab a cup of coffee or see your neighbor on a walk, strike up a conversation. You might just find you feel happier afterward.
 
 Do you have a smartphone that you frequently check while out and about? Think about putting it away a bit more. Whether you're looking up directions or checking the news while waiting in line, research suggests that technology can get in the way of social opportunities.8
 
 Practice Self-Care
 
 When you're feeling lonely, be sure you're doing what you can to take care of yourself in other ways. Self-care is always a good idea, but especially when you are feeling down. Eating nutritious food, exercising, and getting enough sleep will only make you feel better in the long run. Bonus: Take a workout class or join a running club for exercise and social interaction.
 
  5 Self-Care Practices for Every Area of Your Life
 
 Keep Busy
 
 Distract yourself from those feelings of loneliness and make a date with yourself. Do you have a hobby you've always wanted to take up or a home improvement project that's been lingering on your to-do list? Take some time to invest in yourself and your interests and keep your mind occupied in the process.

 See a Therapist
 
 Research suggests that loneliness and symptoms of depression can perpetuate each other, meaning the more lonely you are, the more depressed you feel, and vice versa.3
 
 Sometimes just “getting out there” and meeting other people isn’t enough. It's possible to still feel lonely when you’re around them, which could actually be a sign of depression or social anxiety. If this is the case for you, it may be a good idea to seek psychotherapy to help with feelings of loneliness, especially if you also feel other symptoms of depression.
 
 Some forms of therapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you to change your thoughts as well as your actions to help you not only experience less loneliness but have more tools to prevent it. Whatever you do to combat loneliness, know that you are truly not alone, and there are many things you can do to feel more connected.

 Magnesium and the Brain
 
 Magnesium and Depression
 
 Reasons You Might Be Magnesium Deficient
 
 How to Increase Your Magnesium Levels
 
 Magnesium is an essential mineral that is critical for health. It plays a role in a wide variety of body functions including the formation of DNA, bone formation, and the regulation of nerve and muscle function. Low levels have also been linked to the development of depression.
 
 Magnesium and the Brain
 
 In the brain, magnesium helps to regulate the actions of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. These receptors are believed to play an important role in memory formation and learning. 
 
 Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that is important for normal function in the brain. In excess, however, it can cause cells to become overstimulated. This overexcitation of cells ultimately leads to cell death and is linked to conditions such as seizures, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
 
 In addition to contributing to these neurological conditions, excessive glutamate activity is also linked to depression and anxiety.
 
 Magnesium blocks the actions of glutamate in the NMDA receptors. If your body is magnesium deficient, it means that few of the NMDA receptors are blocked. This may lead to overexcitation and cell damage. Because of this, it is possible that magnesium may be useful in the treatment and prevention of depression.
 
 Since magnesium plays such an important role in health, a deficiency in this important nutrient could potentially predispose people to a number of different health problems, including depression.1",,

 In fact, there are even flow charts, called algorithms, which outline a logical progression that doctors might follow in determining what the best antidepressant is for you. These algorithms are based on the current knowledge in the medical field about which type of antidepressant works best for which patient.
 
 Still, there is no telling what you may or may not respond to. In fact, many people don't respond to their first antidepressant, or they experience undesirable side effects, so they have to try a second, third, or fourth option before finding what works best for them.1",,

 Depression can appear suddenly or gradually. It can be related to a situation (as with adjustment disorders) or there may be no ""reason"" at all.

 Why You May Not Know You're Depressed
 
 There are several possible explanations for being depressed and not knowing it. Depression might not be on your radar, either due to denial or stigma, or you may dismiss your symptoms because you've been experiencing them for so long. You may even be mistaking the symptoms of depression for something else.
 
 The following are some reasons why you may not realize that you are depressed:
 
 You've been depressed for a while. If you have been depressed for a long time, it simply feels normal to you. This may be especially true for those who have been depressed since early childhood.
 
 You don't feel sad. Because you may not be feeling particularly sad, you may think it can't possibly be depression. In reality, depression can take more forms than just a feeling of profound sadness. You may feel tired, low in energy, or lack in any real sense of joy without necessarily feeling sadness or being weepy.1",,

 Coping
 
 Birthday depression, or the birthday blues, refers to feeling sad, apathetic, or disinterested in celebrating or thinking about your birthday.
 
 In addition to experiencing sadness, birthday depression can also include a sense of low energy or focusing on the past, including everything that you may or may not have accomplished so far. These feelings may arise in the days leading up to a person’s birthday, on the actual day, and for some time after as well.
 
 This article explores some possible causes and signs of birthday depression, and offers ways to cope with feelings of sadness on and around your birthday.
 
 Birthday Depression and Other Mental Health Conditions
 
 Is birthday depression associated with a mental health condition, or is it situational? “Our diagnostic manual (DSM-5) does not recognize birthday depression as a mental health disorder,” says Dr. Ernesto Lira de la Rosa, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist and member of the media advisory group at the Hope for Depression Research Foundation.
 
 However, he notes that this does not mean that individuals don’t experience depression or sadness during a birthday.
 
 ""It [birthday depression] could be associated with other mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety. For individuals who have a history of depression, it would not be uncommon for them to experience sadness around their birthdays as well.""
 
  What Is Clinical Depression?
 
 Potential Causes and Reasons
 
 “For some, it could be tied to previous negative experiences with birthdays. Others may reflect on their lives and may not feel they are where they wanted to be by that specific age,” says Dr. Lira de la Rosa. “For others, birthdays can come during times when they are going through something difficult.”
 
 He adds that if someone has experienced trauma in their lives, they may experience their birthday as a trigger, depending on the context and duration of when they experienced the trauma.
 
 There could be several reasons why somebody may experience birthday depression. Other potential causes as to why someone may feel down around their birthday may include:
 
 Depression
 
 Anxiety
 
 Fear of getting old
 
 History of family drama on birthdays during childhood
 
 “All of these and many other reasons can contribute to feeling sad during a birthday,” says Dr. Lira de la Rosa, who notes that all of these reasons are normal and valid as well. 
 
 Symptoms
 
 Dr. Lira de la Rosa says many of the symptoms related to birthday depression are similar to symptoms of regular depression. So, how can you know if you have birthday depression?
 
 Certain signs may alert you that you are experiencing the birthday blues, including but not limited to the following:
 
 A change in your mood that persists and lasts for several days surrounding your birthday
 
 Feeling more low, down, or sad than usual
 
 Crying more often than usual
 
 Ruminating on the past and goals unaccomplished (e.g., not getting married or having kids yet)
 
 Stressing about how much time you have left to live
 
 Not having much energy or motivation to do things
 
 Lack of interest in doing what you typically enjoy
 
 Changes in sleep
 
 Changes in appetite
 
 Difficulty focusing or concentrating
 
 Physical aches or pains
 
 Wanting to avoid the actual day of your birthday
 
 Disinterest in celebrating your birthday (e.g., rejecting or refusing plans to celebrate with friends or family)
 
 Desire to isolate yourself

 How to Cope With Birthday Depression
 
 There are different treatments and coping mechanisms to choose from that may help to heal your birthday blues and simply ease any negative feelings.
 
 To alleviate your birthday blues and better understand where they come from, you may benefit from trying any of these strategies outlined below.
 
 Allow Your Emotions to Arise
 
 “We tend to associate birthdays with celebrations and positive experiences, and that may not be the case for everyone. So, if you are not feeling excited or happy during this time, allow yourself permission to sit with the sadness,” says Dr. Lira de la Rosa.
 
 Allowing yourself to feel your emotions without judgment can enable you to process the deeper meaning behind it and maybe relieve some of the sadness you feel.
 
 Practice Awareness and Self-Compassion
 
 Becoming aware of your experience and being kind to yourself during the process is important. Dr. Lira de la Rosa recommends turning inward to take inventory of your feelings, thoughts, and where you hold tension in your body to better understand what you may be going through.
 
 “If we increase our awareness about our feelings, we can approach these feelings with compassion. We can self-soothe and remind ourselves that we are human beings and that when we feel a range of emotions, that is okay,” says Dr. Lira de la Rosa.
 
 “When we try to avoid the emotions, we may be increasing the intensity of the emotion and we will continue to feel it until we process it.”
 
 Talk About Your Experience With Someone You Trust
 
 Express your feelings to a friend or family member. Someone you know may go through the same thing during their birthday, which can be validating and affirming to hear. Others may be able to listen and help you feel better.
 
 Either way, being open and vulnerable about how you feel with someone who is willing to hold space for you to vent can provide relief.
 
 Celebrate However You Feel Comfortable
 
 “Some people may feel guilty for feeling this way when loved ones or friends want to celebrate and plan festivities, when the birthday person may just want to avoid these kinds of celebrations,” says Dr. Lira de la Rosa.
 
 He encourages people who feel this way to vocalize their feelings, wants, and needs regarding their birthday and not do anything that makes them feel worse or guilty.
 
 It’s your day, so do whatever you feel comfortable with, whether that’s pushing past your negative feelings to celebrate with loved ones or staying home to take care of yourself.
 
 Prepare for Your Birthday With Healthy Activities
 
 “Others may benefit from acknowledging that they may experience sadness during a birthday and put some things in place to help alleviate or lessen the intensity of the sadness. It could be something like preparing for the upcoming birthday and doing things that will help you feel connected to others or yourself.”
 
 However you choose to prepare, prioritize doing activities that make you feel good and lead to improved emotional, physical, and mental health.
 
 Speak to a Therapist
 
 If you would like to find the root cause(s) for feeling sad on your birthday, practice deeper self-reflection with the help of a therapist.
 
 “If the person feels ready to delve into these underlying reasons why they may experience birthday depression, then I would recommend giving therapy a try,” says Dr. Lira de la Rosa. “Others may want to explore their experiences of sadness during their birthdays and could also benefit from talking with a therapist as they explore these experiences.”

 Although birthdays are typically associated with happy feelings and positive experiences, this may not be the case for everybody.
 
 If you experience birthday depression, please don’t feel ashamed. It’s very common and normal for people to feel sad around their birthday. However, if your birthday depression leads to extreme feelings of sadness, anxiety, or isolation, you may want to consult a mental health professional for help.

 Depression is hard to comprehend when you’re experiencing it and even harder to explain to those around you. Some days, you may feel like yourself and other days you may struggle to finish a daily task like eat a full meal or take out the trash. 
 
 Major depressive disorder may be one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States, but it isn’t always recognizable from the outside and symptoms vary significantly from person to person. If your depression isn’t addressed, it can worsen. This is why it’s important to keep your partner in the loop.
 
 Your partner should be your advocate, your cheerleader, the person who knows you best, but telling them about your depression can feel awkward, uncomfortable, and stressful. How do you get them to understand the severity of your feelings? How do you tell them without worrying them?
 
 Learn how to communicate your emotions and struggles with your partner so they can help support you.
 
 Outline Your Goals and Intentions
 
 “Maybe you’re looking for support, compassion, or understanding,” says Jennifer Mann, LCSW, a New York City-based psychotherapist. “Once you identify why you are engaging in this discussion, you can then think of how you want to go about introducing the topic.”
 
 Here are some questions you’ll want to consider as you prepare for the conversation:
 
 How much does your partner know about depression?
 
 What type of reaction are you hoping for?
 
 What type of support do you want from your partner?
 
 Do you want to talk about this on a regular basis? 
 
 Do you want your partner to have an active role in your treatment plan?
 
 What do you not want from your partner?
 
 There’s no right time to tell your partner. If you’re feeling hopelessness, experiencing suicidal thoughts, or contemplating self harm, then you should notify your partner and contact a mental health professional right away.
 
 If your situation isn’t urgent, then you can set aside time that works for you both. 
 
 Ask your partner for at least thirty minutes of their time. You want them to be fully focused on the conversation at hand, so choose a time when the two of you can be alone without distractions. This could be in the evening after your children go to sleep or on the weekend when you don’t have other plans. 
 
 You can begin the conversation by saying, “Right now, I’m not looking for advice, I’m not looking for you to problem solve. I just want to connect with you emotionally and I just want you to understand what I’m experiencing,” says Michael Wheaton, PhD, a licensed psychologist and Assistant Professor of Psychology at Barnard College of Columbia University. 
 
 It can be helpful to give your partner directions, letting them know your intentions in advance. 
 
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.

  Coping With Depression in Relationships
 
 Bring Resources to the Conversation
 
 “Educate yourself as much as you can about depression, says Dr. Wheaton, and offer to share this information with your partner. 
 
 Depression looks and feels different for everyone, so one of the best things you and your partner can do is learn about the many aspects of depression and understand the signs, symptoms, and treatment options available.
 
 Depression can also coincide with many other health and mental health conditions, so this is worth exploring, as there may be an underlying cause that needs attention. 
 
 Dr. Wheaton recommends that if you’re worried your partner won’t understand or will be invalidating, bring reputable information to the conversation.This could include statistics about depression or medical resources that explain what depression is, what it looks like, and how it feels. 
 
 How you bring up the conversation and how you continue the conversation depends on the dynamic of the relationship, but giving your partner information allows them the opportunity to better understand what you’re going through.  
 
 Incorporate Your Partner Into Your Treatment Plan
 
 Maybe you're experiencing a relapse or maybe this is the first time you’ve felt depressed. Regardless, make sure you keep your partner informed of your feelings and your plan to address the depression. You may feel you can handle the mental health disorder on your own, but you shouldn’t.
 
 If you’re working with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, consider ways in which your partner can participate, especially if they’re struggling to understand the depression and how it’s impacting your daily habits and behavior.
 
 If positive activity scheduling or behavioral activation is included in your plan, then Dr. Wheaton suggests asking your partner to support you however possible. Your partner can accompany you on morning walks, for instance, or help you schedule regular meals and establish a routine sleep/wake cycle. 
 
 You could also ask your partner to attend a couple’s therapy session, which could be beneficial for both of you. At the very least, this joint session would allow the partner more insight into your experience. 
 
  How Does Your Depression Affect Your Family?
 
 Keep the Conversation Going
 
 If your partner is not offering support, this is not a reflection of you or your experience. They may not understand the complications of depression or how to help you, or they may think they’re helping you when in reality they’re making the situation more difficult. 
 
 Talking to your partner about your depression can be a powerful way to not only increase your communication with your partner, but also strengthen your bond.
 
 — JENNIFER MANN, LCSW
 
 However, every relationship is unique. What works for one couple might not work for another, which is why you need to maintain strong levels of communication. 
 
 Telling your partner shouldn’t change the relationship, says Dr. Wheaton, but your partner might not know how to respond. If they’re saying, “I don’t know how to act around you,” or “I don’t want to say the wrong thing,” following the discussion, then you can let them know, “I don’t necessarily feel supported,” or “I wish we could connect better around this.” 
 
 A negative response or lack of support could cause problems in the relationship, but this isn’t because of the depression. This may be a sign that the relationship isn’t as strong as it could be. For healthy couples, the conversation will likely bring you closer together.
 
 “Your health should be the top priority,” says Ankur Desai, MD, Medical Director at AmeriHealth Caritas, so regardless of your partner’s response, you should still consider seeking mental health treatment for your depression. ""Healthy emotional functioning is needed to successfully manage life’s demands.""
 
 A Word From Verywell
 
 Your depression has a direct impact on your partner. Your partner may be wondering why you’re irritable on occasion, why you haven’t been engaged in your favorite activities, or why you’re struggling at work. 
 
 Talking about your feelings may not be enjoyable, but it’s beneficial for your mental health. You may be surprised by how much better you feel when your partner knows about the feelings you’ve been harboring.
 
 Best of all, your partner can act as your support system when you seek and undergo treatment for depression. ",,

 I am tired of hearing everyone else say they feel better now that the pandemic is ending. I had depression and anxiety before COVID-19 and my mental health problems are likely to stick around after. What can I do?
 
 —Matt, 36
 
 Amy’s Answer
 
 You’re not alone in feeling this way. While it’s true that some people are feeling better now that restrictions are lifting, other people are feeling worse than usual. While you can’t make your depression and anxiety disappear with the virus, you can keep working on yourself.
 
 Mental Health and the Pandemic
 
 The pandemic reduced some of the stigma surrounding mental health issues. As celebrities, influencers, and icons stepped forward to share some of the struggles they were experiencing during lockdown, it became clear that no one is immune to mental illness.
 
 But, many of those same people are now returning to their everyday lives and their psychological well-being is improving.
 
 I’m hopeful that conversations about mental health are going to stick around even though the world is returning to normal.
 
 For individuals who struggled with mental illness long before COVID, watching other people move forward can be frustrating when you’re feeling stuck.
 
 Even though you might think you’re the only one who is still feeling bad, you’re not. There are plenty of other people who are having a hard time right now, too. So just know you’re not alone.
 
 Get Advice From The Verywell Mind Podcast
 
 Hosted by Editor-in-Chief and therapist Amy Morin, LCSW, this episode of The Verywell Mind Podcast shares seven mental health mistakes to avoid after the pandemic.
 
 Don’t Judge Your Feelings
 
 Whether you’re feeling jealous of people who are feeling happy again or you’re angry that your mental health isn’t getting better, whatever you feel right now is OK.
 
 Try not to be too hard on yourself for those emotions. Telling yourself you shouldn’t feel a certain way will only make you feel worse.
 
 Instead, name your feelings. Just putting a label on them can help your brain make more sense of what’s going on. And that might even make you feel a little better.
 
 Get Ongoing Support
 
 You don’t mention how you’re being treated for your anxiety and depression. Do you see a therapist? Are you taking medication? Do you attend a support group?
 
 Make sure you’re working on a solid treatment plan with professionals you trust. If you aren’t getting any treatment, talk to your physician. Your doctor can refer you to mental health professionals who can assist you.
 
 That’s not to say treatment is going to magically make you feel better. But it can be a step in the right direction.
 
 Of course, if you’re already working with a therapist, your physician, or a psychiatrist, make sure to talk to them about how you’re feeling in relation to the pandemic. It’s important for them to know how this is affecting you.
 
 Talk to Other People
 
 Of course, it’s not just the professionals who can assist you right now. Talking to trusted friends and family members might help too.
 
 You might find that some of them are feeling the exact same way as you. They just might be hesitant to bring it up first.
 
 You might find solace in a support group. There are plenty of online groups for individuals with anxiety and depression. if you don’t feel comfortable going to one in person. Others who have a history of depression and anxiety may know exactly what you’re going through.
 
 Limit Your Time on Social Media
 
 If you’re seeing a lot of people celebrating the pandemic restrictions being lifted on social media, limit who you follow and how much time you spend scrolling through social media.
 
 Don’t be afraid to use the mute function either. If seeing friends going on vacation or hearing about how happy your family members are now that they’re getting together again doesn’t make you feel good, don’t look at it.
 
 Whether you like following mental health accounts that offer actionable tips, or you enjoy keeping tabs on your favorite actor, follow accounts that inspire you to feel your best right now.
 
 Think of Mental Health as an Ongoing Marathon, Not a Sprint
 
 Improving your mental health isn’t a race. There’s no prize for feeling better the fastest. And although you’ll feel better when your mental health improves, trying to rush it will backfire.
 
 It’s also not a competition. 
 
 Mental health is like sunshine. There’s plenty to go around for everyone and someone else’s happiness won’t take anything away from you. 
 
 Managing your mental health is an ongoing process. Think of it more like a marathon rather than a sprint. Even when you’re feeling better, self-care is key to keeping your symptoms at bay. ",,

 Depression Without Sadness
 
 Physical Pain
 
 Globally, 264 million people suffer from depression and it is a leading cause of disability, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In the most recent edition of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-5), there are criteria laid out that help a clinician, or anyone doing their own research, identify depression.
 
 Some of the symptoms of depression include sleep disturbances, suicidal ideation, and low mood. If some of these symptoms persist for two weeks are more, that is usually sufficient to arrive at the diagnosis of major depression (major depressive disorder). 
 
 However, outside of these common key features of depression, the illness can also manifest itself in other ways. These other expressions of a depressive episode are just as real and cause significant distress to the individual. It can also be confusing to the person living through this experience.
 
 Let's take a look at some of the lesser known signs and symptoms of depression.
 
 Rumination
 
 For some, a particularly harmful and taxing feature of depression is rumination.1 The original meaning of this word describes the action of animals known as ruminants, such as cows, who regurgitate their food and chew on it and repeat this cycle over and over again. The mental equivalent of this is reliving and rehashing some unpleasant experience.
 
 An example of this would be if during your last zoom meeting, your co-worker asked you a question that you weren’t prepared to answer. You momentarily stutter before responding that you would have to get back to them with the information. That evening and the next few days to come, you have vivid, intrusive thoughts wherein you mentally re-enact the incident over and over again.
 
 The images of the event play in your mind repeatedly like a horror movie that you would rather not see. You incessantly think about what you could have done differently. You wince and cringe thinking about that excruciating moment when the question was asked. You may wish you could stop reliving that moment but it seems almost involuntary. You feel haunted by the scenes.
 
 This may go on for weeks for some people. This is what the unpleasant experience of rumination can feel like. 
 
  What Are the Signs That You Are Severely Depressed?
 
 Lack of Motivation
 
 Motivation drives our efforts and keeps us moving forward in life. While in a depressive episode, a person may find that the motivation to get through the day remains just beyond their fingertips.2 Lack of motivation doesn’t just mean not being able to do big things like starting that new business. It can also mean not being able to complete simple daily tasks. It can make brushing your teeth feel like a huge feat.
 
 When depression has zapped your motivation, you can have the intention of getting some groceries. You know you need to get out the door, after all, there’s practically nothing in your fridge but a few soy sauce packets and a questionable burrito.
 
 You put one shoe on, then sit on the couch, and just stare. Then you manage to get the other shoe on, but you can’t immediately find your keys. You get demoralized and never make it to the store.
 
 This is a particularly detrimental symptom of depression because there are lifestyle changes such as exercise, a balanced diet, and a meditation practice that can be helpful with alleviating depression. However, without the motivation that turns good intentions into good behaviors, frustration with oneself instead of meaningful change is the inevitable result.
 
 Many patients amaze themselves when they are in recovery from depression because they are able to do the laundry, fold it, and put it away all in the same day. 
 
  How Exercise Can Help Reduce Depressive Symptoms
 
 Anger and Irritability
 
 There are certainly times in life when anger is justified and makes sense. However, with depression, anger can linger for longer than makes sense for the situation and also be out of proportion. Expressed anger correlates with higher intensity of depressive symptoms.3",,

 The first thing you should know about overcoming depression is that it is possible. Your choices matter and can make an impact on the course of your illness.
 
 Fortunately, lots of research has been done on some of the lifestyle choices and treatment options that can potentially shorten a depressive episode or decrease the likelihood of a relapse.
 
 Depression is such a complicated illness and effects each individual differently. It makes sense then that there isn’t one silver bullet for recovery from depression. Successful management of depression is typically achieved using a multi-pronged or the ‘come at it from all angles’ approach.

 What Are Depression Naps? 
 
 To many people, it won’t come as a surprise that sleep and mental health are closely intertwined. Sleeping for extensive amounts of time is commonly associated with diagnoses of depression, which is usually accompanied by several other symptoms and identifying factors.
 
 In fact, several studies have shown that between 65% to 90% of adult patients with major depression have experienced sleep dysfunction in some form.1 One example is by napping for long periods on a daily basis, a practice also referred to as a “depression nap.”
 
 According to Alex Dimitriu, MD, a psychiatrist and sleep medicine specialist and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine in Menlo Park, California, depression naps refer to taking a nap when you’re feeling low, in an effort to boost your mood. But it might not necessarily indicate a serious problem.
 
 “It is important to realize there is a very big difference between feeling tired, sleepy, sad, and depressed,” Dr. Dimitriu says. “A lot of times it can be hard to know your own feelings, and too often in my work, people with fatigue end up thinking they are depressed.”
 
 Characteristics, Traits, and Symptoms
 
 Just like feelings of depression can lead people to want to sleep all the time, being in a general state of sleep deprivation, whether it comes from caring for young kids, dealing with long work hours and work-related stress, or other personal reasons can also contribute to feelings of depression.
 
  When it comes to distinguishing fatigue from sleepiness from depression, it helps to understand each one in more detail, and also to realize that getting an adequate seven to eight hours of sleep per night would likely benefit all three issues, Dr. Dimitriu says. 
 
 Sleepiness is usually the easiest to identify. You can do so by asking yourself if you would be able to fall asleep right now.
 
 If sleep deprivation is the true issue, taking steps to clean up your sleep hygiene and prioritizing sleep as crucial for your health and well being can truly make a difference.
 
 Fatigue, meanwhile, is different from sleepiness, with low energy, reduced motivation and drive, but not necessarily a desire to sleep, he says. With fatigue, your body may physically feel tired, which can also be a sign of another underlying health issue, which highlights the importance of keeping up with regular doctors’ visits and keeping your provider updated on any and all concerns.
 
 Finally, depression is marked chiefly by low mood and loss of interest in pleasure on most days for two weeks, Dr. Dimitriu says. Additional symptoms can include lowered energy, loss of interest in daily activities, feelings of hopelessness, low appetite, and even thoughts of suicide. “It’s worth noting that depressed people can also have an increased need for sleep, as well as symptoms of fatigue, like low energy and low motivation,” Dr. Dimitriu says.
 
 If you suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of depression, it’s key to seek professional help to appropriately navigate the path forward.
 
 Diagnosis or Identifying Depression Naps
 
 It can be hard to pinpoint whether a napping habit is truly a symptom of depression, or if you’re just exhausted, Dr. Dimitriu says. The first step is to confirm whether basic human needs are being met, such as getting enough sleep for at least a week, eating healthy, some socialization, and exercise
 
 Working too much and playing too little can also cause burnout or depression, terms that are often used interchangeably, which can add further confusion. “If someone experiences low mood on more days than not, with a loss of interest in pleasure or lack of joy, it may be time to speak to a professional,” Dr. Dimitriu says. “However, thoughts of death or suicide are an immediate red flag that professional help is needed.”
 
 Causes
 
 The desire to nap can be brought on by sheer exhaustion on its own, as well as underlying mental health issues. Depression is often tied to insomnia, so if you’re chronically sleep deprived, it makes sense that you would experience feeling low and exhausted all at the same time.
 
 However, people who are depressed also often find themselves feeling alert at the same time and not actually able to sleep during the day, which adds to the importance of seeking a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
 
 Treatment
 
 If you’ve sought out professional help for underlying depression, your provider can help you determine the appropriate treatment path, such as regular therapy sessions, prescription medication, or both. If the problem is tied more to your sleep patterns, seeking help from an expert can also help you to clean up your sleep hygiene and develop better sleeping habits and patterns.
 
 Sometimes simple steps like going to bed at the same time every night or refraining from using mobile devices in bed can make a huge difference in restoring a healthy sleep routine.
 
 Coping
 
 Once you’ve appropriately identified what you’re experiencing, you can determine if you need to take action to adjust your routine and habits. Naps, if kept to about 30 minutes long and not too close to bedtime, can be a nice way to recharge and reframe thinking, Dr. Dimitriu says. As long as they don't interfere with nighttime sleep, or result from not getting enough sleep at night, they can be healthy and restorative.
 
 “In a sleep-deprived society, fatigue is all too often the cause of low mood, low motivation, and increased anxiety and impulsivity,” Dr. Dimitriu says. “In these cases, sleeping more often will help.” 
 
 A Word From Verywell
 
 If you’ve felt a bit blue, short naps aren’t a harmful thing—in fact, they can be restorative and help you feel refreshed and better able to maintain productivity during the remainder of your day. As long as you’ve sought professional help where necessary to rule out underlying mental health conditions, an occasional nap can be effective for boosting your mood.",,

 Assess Your Symptoms
 
 Everyone experiences a lack of motivation from time to time. On days like this, you might feel tired, irritable, or just unable to stir your usual interest in the things you typically enjoy. 
 
 Occasional periods of feeling this way are perfectly normal. It might mean that you're under extra stress or trying to deal with something out of the ordinary in your life. These feelings are temporary and usually nothing serious. They can sometimes be a sign that you need to step back, take a break, and let your mind and body rest.
 
 At other times, these lingering feelings where you don’t feel like doing anything can be symptoms of more serious problems such as depression or some other type of mood disorder. If you are experiencing a loss of interest in things you usually find pleasurable or a sense of apathy about life in general that lasts for more than two weeks, talk to your doctor.
 
 If these feelings seem like a more temporary state of mind, there are some things you can do to feel better and regain your motivation.
 
 Take a Break
 
 Feeling like you don’t want to do anything can be a sign that you're stressed or burned out. Sometimes taking a break and spending some time taking care of yourself is the best thing you can do. 
 
 Consider giving yourself a “mental health day” where you let go of your expectations of what you think you are supposed to accomplish. Instead, focus on doing things that help you feel restored and comforted. 
 
 Let yourself enjoy a nap or lounge with a cozy blanket and your favorite book. The key is to spend this time relaxing and letting your mind and body rest.
 
 Sometimes some fairly simple self-care can help put you in a better frame of mind. Try taking a shower, do some stretching, and have a glass of water. 
 
 Treat Yourself Kindly
 
 Self-compassion involves not only being kind to yourself but also understanding that your experiences are part of being human and being mindful of your own emotions, the good and the bad.
 
 Showing yourself some compassion and consideration can have important mental health benefits. Research has found that when people show compassion to themselves, it can help alleviate the negative effects of stress, reduce feelings of depression and anxiety, and lower overall psychological distress.1",,

 Why You Should Talk About Depression
 
 What to Consider Before You Disclose
 
 Disclosing Your Depression
 
 Deciding to tell the people you love that you're struggling with depression is a big step. Not only is it challenging to find the energy to reach out to people, but there are naturally worries about how the news of your diagnosis will be received.
 
 Unfortunately, there are too many misconceptions about mental health and what it means and the last thing you need is to be judged negatively because of it.
 
 But, opening up about your depression is one of the most effective ways to get the help and support you need at a time when you likely feel vulnerable and alone, especially if you choose to disclose your illness to people that you know and trust.
 
 Remember though, you are in control and you get to choose who knows and who doesn't. Just don't let fear of the unknown keep you from opening up to the people who care about you.
 
 If you're considering disclosing your diagnosis to the people close to you but just aren't sure how to start the conversation, here are some things to consider.
 
 Why You Should Talk About Depression
 
 Naturally, the prospect of disclosing your depression to other people is scary. You have no way of knowing for sure how they will respond.
 
 But choosing to tell the people closest to you about your diagnosis and your struggles can be very healing, especially if they offer support and encouragement.
 
 In fact, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, simply talking to a sympathetic person can reduce your stress level and improve your mood.1",,

 Teens may begin to withdraw from family members for a number of reasons. But depression can lead to feelings of anger and irritability, which can result in an ongoing negative attitude or even defiance. Symptoms of depression can also cause people to feel that they are unlovable or unwanted.
 
 Problems Competing in Sports
 
 Fatigue and lack of energy are common symptoms of depression. Because of low energy levels, teens may find it more difficult to compete in sports or physical education courses.
 
 Other common symptoms such as irritability, lack of confidence, and difficulties getting along with peers can make taking part in group sports a challenge.
 
 Declining School Performance
 
 Depression can make it hard for teenagers to function fully in academic settings. Symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, lack of interest, fatigue, mood swings, and worthlessness can impair school performance.
 
 Dropping grades are sometimes a sign that a teen may be struggling with symptoms of depression.
 
 Social Issues
 
 Depression can make it difficult to relate to others. People often feel worthless or unworthy of attention from other people. People who are depressed also tend to withdraw socially, which can further contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
 
 Substance Use
 
 People sometimes turn to drugs and alcohol in an effort to self-medicate, self-treat sleeping difficulties, cope with suicidal thoughts. Feelings of depression may lead teens to try drugs or alcohol, and continued use may contribute to continued feelings of depression.
 
 One study found that symptoms of depression were linked to the initiation of drug use by teens.1",,

 How to Help
 
 Although “smiling depression” isn’t a clinical diagnosis, for many people, it's a real problem. Typically, smiling depression occurs when individuals who are experiencing depression mask their symptoms. They hide behind a smile to convince other people that they are happy.
 
 Consequently, this type of depression often goes undetected because when most people imagine a depressed individual, they think of someone who looks really sad or cries a lot. And while it's true that sadness and unexplained bouts of crying are common characteristics of depression, not everyone looks sad when they’re depressed.
 
 Individuals with smiling depression often look happy to the outside world and keep their depression a secret.
 
 Signs and Symptoms
 
 Whether you’re the one who works hard to pretend you’re happy when you’re not, or you have a loved one that you suspect might be hiding their pain, understanding smiling depression can help you take positive action. Here's an overview of the signs and symptoms of smiling depression.

 If your teen appears to be depressed, you may have suggested that is time to get help. What can you do if they refuse to get help? Unfortunately, this is more common than many parents would like to believe.
 
 A depressed teen usually doesn't realize that depression is the reason for changes in how they are feeling or acting. Part of the disorder is not thinking clearly enough to see what's really going on and feeling too lousy to deal with it even if you do.
 
 There are a number of effective approaches to ease a teen into taking the first steps in facing depression and getting the help they need. There's no right or wrong way to do this. Start with the method that seems to best fit your teen's personality and problems. If that doesn't work, try another.

 Tips for Helping a Depressed Teen
 
 If you are concerned that your teen may be depressed, but they appear uninterested in getting help or perhaps outright refuse it, there are steps that you can take to help them. Proceed with gentle but firm methods to persuade your teen to get help. These varied approaches have all been effective in helping depressed teens move forward.
 
 Communication
 
 Talking openly and honestly with your teen is the first step.
 
 Talk in specific terms about the signs and changes you've seen in them that concern you and that point to possible depression.
 
 Discuss untreated depression and how it can negatively impact them.
 
 Make a compassionate deal. For example, tell them that if they'll agree to getting an evaluation with a therapist specializing in teen depression, you'll treat them to a hot fudge sundae or another reward that motivates them.
 
 Attempt to empathize with the pain your teen is feeling. For example, discuss that while you can't know exactly how they're feeling, outwardly they seem unhappy.

 ways to cope with irritability
 
 Verywell / Laura Porter
 
 Everyone feels irritable sometimes. But, if you’re not careful, your irritability could cause some bigger problems in your life. Whether you say things you don’t mean and it harms your relationships or you struggle to stay productive at work because you’re annoyed by people around you, it’s important to address your irritability.
 
 These strategies can help reduce your irritability so you can feel better.
 
 Acknowledge Your Irritability
 
 When someone asks why you’re so grumpy, it’s tempting to snap at them and say, “I’m not grumpy!” You might even blame everyone else for being too sensitive, too loud, or too annoying.
 
 But denying your irritability is likely to make you feel worse.
 
 When you notice that you’re feeling annoyed with everything and everyone around you, acknowledge that you’re irritable.
 
 You don’t necessarily have to announce that you’re feeling irritable. You might just acknowledge it to yourself.
 
 Studies show naming your feelings can take a lot of the intensity out of them. You might even rate your irritability on a scale of 1 to 10. One study found that when individuals ranked their anger on a scale, their physiological symptoms declined and they felt calmer.1",,

 What to do when you feel hopeless
 
 Verywell / Catherine Song
 
 Whether you feel hopeless about your ability to get out of debt or you feel hopeless about almost everything in life, it is an awful feeling.
 
 Feeling stuck in a place of hopelessness makes life really tough.1 Fortunately, there are some things you can do when you feel hopeless to make life a bit better—no matter how bad things might seem.
 
 Consider That Your Brain Might Be Lying to You
 
 Your brain might tell you that things are awful, horrible, and dreadful. It may try to convince you that you can’t succeed or tell you that there’s no chance things are going to get better.
 
 But just because you think it, doesn’t mean it’s true. Your thoughts may be distorted, inaccurate, or downright wrong.
 
 Hopeless feelings fuel hopeless thoughts. And it’s easy to get caught up in a negative cycle that makes it hard to see that things can get better.2
 
 You might even think things like, “I’ve tried everything already and nothing works!” But that’s probably a cognitive distortion. You may have tried a few things—or even 10 things—but you likely haven’t tried everything.
 
 At least be open to the idea that the way you’re thinking might not be accurate. There may be more hope than you imagine.
 
 Argue the Opposite
 
 When you feel hopeless, you’ll likely think about all the reasons why nothing will ever get better. So take a few minutes to argue the opposite.
 
 What’s the evidence that things might work out better than you expect? Or how might things actually get better?
 
 Thinking a bit about the potential positives can open you up to more possibilities. And while there’s a chance that things might not turn out great, there’s also a chance that they might not turn out as bad (or stay as bad) as you’re anticipating.
 
 Arguing the opposite might just open your brain up to the idea that things may not be as gloomy as you’re anticipating.
 
 Think About What You Gain From Being Hopeless
 
 Thinking about what you gain from being hopeless sounds like a strange exercise on the surface. After all, you might be thinking, “I don’t gain anything. I don’t want to feel this way.”
 
 But, upon a little more reflection you might discover that feeling hopeless protects you from being disappointed. If you don’t expect anything good to happen, you don’t have to worry about being disappointed if things go poorly.
 
 Being hopeless also might help you feel all right about not taking action.
 
 For example, if you’re hopeless that you’ll ever pay off your debt, you might not bother trying to increase your income (by getting another job) or you might not manage your spending (by creating a budget).
 
 So consider whether you might be gaining something by remaining hopeless. You might find it somehow protects you from creating change or doing anything differently.3
 
 Consider What You Could Gain From Developing Hope
 
 On the flipside, consider what you could gain if you became more hopeful. How might your life change? What would you be doing differently if you had hope?
 
 Then, you might go ahead and start acting as if you were hopeful.
 
 For example, you might realize that if you had hope, you’d be going out and meeting new people. Or, you’d be applying for a new job. Go do those things, even if you aren’t hopeful, they’ll work.
 
 Sometimes, you have to change your behavior first and the feelings might follow. So if you act hopeful, you might start to eventually feel more hopeful.3
 
 Engage In Problem-Solving
 
 Hopelessness, by definition, is the belief that things aren’t going to get better or that you can’t succeed. But, there is always something you can do to solve a problem or to change how you feel about the problem.
 
 Spend some time thinking about potential solutions to the problem. Brainstorm ideas and keep them in mind, you don’t even necessarily need good ideas. Just see if you can come up with as many strategies as you can to address a problem.3
 
 If you can’t solve the problem (like in the case of a loved one’s illness), consider how to change how you feel about the problem. Could spending time with family members help you feel a little better? Might you feel a little more hopeful if you took a mental health day from the workplace?
 
 There’s always something you can do to make things a little better or to help yourself feel a little better.
 
 Talk to a Trusted Friend or Family Member
 
 When you’re struggling to identify possible solutions or you are having a hard time getting unstuck, reach out to a trusted friend or family member. Tell them what you’re experiencing.
 
 They may be able to help you see things from a different perspective. Or, they may offer strategies that can help you feel better.
 
 It can be hard to tell people what you’re going through. However, telling someone could be key to helping you gain a little more hope about your situation.4
 
  Tips on Disclosing Your Depression to Friends
 
 Develop a Plan
 
 After you’ve developed ideas—by yourself and/or with someone else—create a plan. Decide what step you are going to take first.
 
 Keep in mind that if plan A doesn’t work, you can always have a plan B. Think of your plan as an experiment and your job is to run as many experiments as you can until you discover what works.
 
 Take Action
 
 Once you have a plan in place, it’s important to take action.
 
 After all, you likely won’t gain hope about your situation by sitting still. Instead, you’ll gain more hope when you start putting yourself out there and start seeing what you can do.3

 Seek Professional Help
 
 Hopelessness can be a symptom of a mental health issue, like depression.5 So if your feelings of hopelessness last more than two weeks or you’re concerned about your mental health, talk to someone.
 
 A mental health professional can assess your needs and discuss your treatment options, like talk therapy or medication. Most mental health issues are very treatable. Treatment can help you feel more hopeful about the future.

 Feeling worthless often involves a sense of hopelessness and insignificance. Such feelings are often a common symptom of depression, but can also arise due to things such as low self-esteem, neglect, abuse, trauma, or difficult situations that pose a threat to a person's sense of self.
 
 Feeling worthless can create significant distress and make it difficult to function normally in daily life. You might find it difficult to feel motivated to pursue your goals when you feel that nothing you do is right or that none of your efforts will make a difference. Because of this, it is important to find ways to manage these difficult feelings and seek help when needed.
 
 Why You Might Be Feeling Worthless?
 
 Feelings of worthlessness can be caused by a number of different factors. Upbringing, social experiences, explanatory style, stressful events, and mental health conditions may all play a role. Some reasons why you might be struggling with such feelings include:
 
 Childhood Trauma
 
 You may have had negative childhood experiences that have left a lasting mark. Neglect, abuse, and maltreatment during childhood can all play a role in the development of feelings of worthlessness. Children who are abused or who are frequently criticized by parents or other caregivers may carry those feelings of insignificance into adulthood. Research has shown that these early interpersonal traumas are linked to later feelings of worthlessness.1",,

 What to do when you feel helpless.
 
 Verywell / Laura Porter
 
 Feeling helpless is something that many people experience from time to time. It's a feeling that can strike following a period of stress or as a response to trauma. In other cases, it can be a symptom of a mental illness such as depression.
 
 When you feel helpless, it can be difficult to stay motivated to change your situation. Fortunately, there are some things that you can do to feel better able to tackle life's challenges.
 
 Identify the Source
 
 If you feel like there is nothing you can do to change the situation, it can help to assess and evaluate the source of your feelings. Some questions you might ask:
 
 Have you been coping with a great deal of stress lately?
 
 Have you recently experienced a trauma or setback?
 
 Is something happening in the world that is outside of your control?
 
 Or have you been struggling with other symptoms such as low mood, sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest that might be connected?
 
 Evaluating some of the factors that might be playing a part in your feelings of helplessness can help you decide what tactics might be the most helpful. For example, if daily stresses are making you feel helpless, finding ways to control chronic stress may set you back into a more resilient mindset.
 
 If the problem is something outside of your control, managing how you relate and respond to the problem may be more helpful.
 
 Understand Why You Might Resist Change
 
 When you are experiencing a difficult or negative emotion like helplessness, it can sometimes be helpful to look at some of the reasons why you might be resisting feeling empowered. This doesn’t mean that you are necessarily choosing helplessness—but it might be something that you resist changing because the alternative is frightening.
 
 Not feeling helpless might mean that you are ready to make a big change in your life. Overcoming those negative feelings might compel you to take on challenges that can also be difficult, challenging, or even overwhelming.
 
 The important thing to remember is that changing your mindset can be hard and it presents its own unique set of challenges. But it also opens up a new world of opportunity and rewards that are worth pursuing.
 
 Focus on What You Can Control
 
 When you spend too much time ruminating over the things you cannot change, you are more likely to magnify feelings of helplessness. Focusing on those unchangeable things only leaves you feeling more defeated. 
 
 Giving attention to the things that you can control, however, can help you feel more capable. It provides a greater sense of agency and can give you the motivation and energy to work toward making a change. 
 
 The global COVID-19 pandemic is an example of a traumatic event that has left many people feeling helpless and often overwhelmed. Because so many aspects of the situation are outside of each individual’s control, people can improve their sense of empowerment by managing the things that are within their power to control.
 
 Get Advice From The Verywell Mind Podcast
 
 Hosted by Editor-in-Chief and therapist Amy Morin, LCSW, this episode of The Verywell Mind Podcast shares how you can take control of your life.
 
 Remember Your Thoughts Might Not Be Accurate
 
 Cognitive distortions are your brain’s way of misinterpreting events, coming to faulty conclusions, and believing things that are just downright wrong. When you are dealing with a difficult emotion like helplessness, it is important to remember that your brain isn’t always telling you the truth.
 
 So the next time you find yourself going down the “nothing will ever change” or “there’s nothing I can do that will make a difference” rabbit hole of negative thoughts, try to step back for a moment and take a more realistic view. 
 
 It isn’t always easy to change these kinds of thought patterns. Learning how to recognize them is the first step toward changing them, however.
 
 Challenge Your Helpless Feelings
 
 Once you start to recognize those helpless thoughts and feelings, it is time to start actively challenging and replacing them with more accurate, empowering ones. 
 
 This might involve looking for evidence that points to the opposite. If you feel helpless about trying to achieve a specific goal, think about times that you have successfully accomplished something you set your mind to. 
 
 Look for evidence that disputes your helpless feelings. Think about situations that demonstrate your personal agency.
 
 By actively seeking information that makes you feel more empowered and capable, you’ll be better able to break out of a powerless mindset.
 
 Remember Your Strengths
 
 If you are feeling helpless, it can be beneficial to spend time recognizing your own unique talents, strengths, and abilities. Emphasizing these capabilities is a great way to gain more empowerment and motivation to tackle challenges you might be facing in different areas of your life. 
 
 Consider making a list of the things you are good at and then think about the ways you might use those skills to tackle a problem. Rather than ruminate on your weaknesses, focus your time on appreciating and honing your strengths.
 
 Practice Acceptance
 
 While it might seem counterproductive, acknowledging the things that are outside of your control may actually improve your ability to accept them. Feeling like you have to control everything can actually make you feel more helpless and even hopeless when you find yourself overwhelmed by the reality of the situation.
 
 Research suggests that when people mistakenly believe they can control the future, they actually end up feeling even more distressed.1",,

 Depression is more complicated than most people think. It’s not just about being sad and it certainly isn’t about being lazy. But those are common misconceptions that sometimes prevent people from seeking treatment and getting the help they need to feel better.
 
 Even when you’re experiencing depression, it can be tough to identify how you’re feeling and it can be hard to take steps to improve your mood and outlook in the moment.
 
 That’s why we put together this article—to help you on your journey in coping with your symptoms. A better understanding of how you’re feeling and what action you can take can empower you to live your best life even when you’re feeling depressed.
 
 Understanding Your Emotions
 
 Some people experience more irritability than sadness when they're depressed, other people report feelings of guilt and hopelessness. And while some people report their emotions stay pretty constant, other people say their depression causes their emotions to shift pretty quickly.
 
 Before you can make decisions about how to best cope with depression or what types of treatments you want to try, it’s important to gain a better understanding of the emotions you’re experiencing.
 
 Then, you can develop a plan for dealing with each of those emotions you're encountering. What works to calm you down when you’re feeling anxious might not be helpful when you’re feeling unappreciated.
 
 Learning to identify these emotional components you're encountering can help you develop strategies to feel better sooner. And while everyone's experience with depressive symptoms is a little different, developing a better understanding of the emotions you're encountering can help you determine which coping skills work best for you.
 
 Taking Small Steps
 
 Your depression will try to convince you that nothing will work to help you feel better. It’ll tell you there’s no use in trying any formal treatment and any steps you take to improve your emotional state will be useless.
 
 It may tell you that there's no sense in taking medication because it won't work. Or, your depression might try to convince you that you shouldn't talk to a therapist because talking won't help. Consequently, you might not take any action that could help you feel better.
 
 That’s what depression does to your brain—it makes you think unrealistically negative thoughts.
 
 But, the truth is, you won’t know if various strategies work until you try them. You don’t have any take huge leaps to help yourself feel better (that’s likely to feel overwhelming when you’re depressed). Instead, you can try small steps to see if specific strategies help you feel better.
 
 A great mantra to create for yourself: “Let’s try.” Even as your depression tries to talk you out of doing something, remind yourself, you won’t know if it could help until you at least give it a try.
 
 To do so, however, you'll have to go against what your brain is telling you. For example, depression might try to convince you to just stay in bed all day. But staying in bed is likely to keep you stuck in a depressed mood.
 
 You might have to push yourself to get up, get dressed, go for a walk, or call a friend. While you might think none of things will help you feel better (or you might even think they'll make you feel worse), getting active might decrease your symptoms a little if you're willing to try.
 
 Think of various coping strategies as experiments. Some of them may help you feel better and others might not necessarily work for you. But the more experiments you try, the better equipped you'll be in identifying which strategies best reduce your symptoms.
 
 A Word From Verywell
 
 While it’s important to have professionals who are helping you manage your depression, like a physician and a therapist, there are also many strategies you can try at home to alleviate your symptoms.

 Many people think depression is just a deep sadness that doesn’t go away for a while. That’s not the whole story, however. Depression is more complicated than that.
 
 That’s why many people who have depression don’t recognize it as such. And it’s why people often show disbelief when they learn someone has depression.
 
 But just because you don’t feel sad or someone says, “But you don’t seem depressed,” doesn’t mean you aren’t. Everyone experiences and displays depression in their own way.
 
 Individuals with depression do share some common emotional experiences, however. Learning to identify your emotions can be the first step in figuring out how to respond to them in a healthy way.
 
 Common Emotions Experienced During Depression
 
 While everyone’s experience with depression is a little different, some emotions during depression are fairly common symptoms:
 
 Sadness: Depression can cause deep feelings of sadness. Feelings of sadness might involve a particular event, like the loss of a loved one or they may just be general feelings of sadness.
 
 Guilt: Depression may make you feel guilty about almost everything. You might feel guilty you’re
 
 depressed or you may feel bad about mistakes (or perceived mistakes) you’ve made.      
 
 Irritability: You may feel irritable much of the time. You may have a lower frustration tolerance or you may just feel annoyed by almost everything going on around you.
 
 Anxiety: You might worry about something specific (like whether you’re going to be able to fall asleep tonight) or you might just feel anxious for no particular reason.       
 
 Loneliness: You might not feel like socializing when you’re depressed but at the same time, you might feel really lonely. Loneliness can be common, even when you’re surrounded by people. 
 
 Worthlessness: You may believe that you don’t have anything to contribute to the world and you might feel as though you’re worthless to your friends and family.       
 
 Hopelessness: Depression can cause you to think that nothing will ever work or that things will never get better.

 Learned helplessness is a state that animals can get in when they regularly meet negative stimuli when they try to escape. After a time, they stop trying to escape completely, assuming that it is hopeless and they are unable to change the situation. This can become so prevalent that even when an escape is presented, they are unable or unwilling to take advantage of it.
 
 This concept of learned helplessness plays a large role in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). If you continually feel helpless due to your anxiety, you may give up looking for a solution, accepting the current state as inevitable and unchanging. Continued inaction can cause you to refuse therapy or medication, even when those things could make a considerable difference.

 Learned helplessness often begins at a young age, such as during childhood.
 
 Scientists hypothesize that distant parenting can worsen learned hopelessness and anxiety, as the child learns early on that they are helpless and that their parents will not come to their aid.
 
 In addition, growing up with parents who suffer from learned helplessness themselves can lead to the child developing it, too.
 
 Over time, as the child ages, they will likely see their situation as being set and determined, unable to be changed. Particularly if they has anxiety, this can be incredibly persistent. They becomes so used to their anxious state of mind that they cannot imagine any other way of living or that recovery could be possible.
 
 The Vicious Cycle
 
 The learned helplessness and anxiety symptoms can be a vicious cycle. If the child is anxious and can't be soothed, they feels like nothing can be done and learned helplessness sets in. The more they accepts it as inevitable, the more anxiety takes hold.
 
 Symptoms of learned helplessness linked to anxiety include:
 
 Frustration
 
 Poor self-esteem
 
 Difficulty sleeping
 
 Treatment
 
 While learned helplessness can be a serious problem, it can be successfully treated if targeted by a mental health professional. Studies have found that if people receive intervention at the onset of learned helplessness, it can be decreased through therapy and coaching. Even at later stages, improvements can be made with regular work. Once this issue is tackled, then treatment for anxiety can begin successfully.

 Getting Help
 
 Not all people with GAD will experience learned helplessness. It develops over the course of time with certain sets of factors at play. Genetic and environmental factors may increase a child's likelihood of developing both GAD and learned helplessness.
 
 If you feel you have gotten stuck in a pattern of learned helplessness, visit a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation to get an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. Through cognitive behavioral therapy, you will learn how to counter your learned helplessness instincts and replace them with more rational, optimistic thoughts.
 
 You may learn to dispute your own assumptions and promote coping skills to manage your symptoms. In some cases, your doctor may recommend medication to help manage your anxiety so that you can concentrate and focus on your treatment.
 
 If you or a loved one are struggling with anxiety, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

 Emotion regulation therapy (ERT) is a type of psychotherapy that has been successfully tested in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and those with co-occurring GAD and major depressive disorder (MDD). Born out of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) tradition, ERT integrates components of cognitive, acceptance and mindfulness-based approaches.
 
 Research has shown that ERT effectively and significantly reduces GAD and MDD symptoms by the end of treatment. The benefits remain at least three and six months after treatment has ended.
 
 Preliminary studies of the mechanism of the intervention (i.e., the possible ways in which it is impacting change) support the idea that this type of talk therapy helps people better attend to emotional conflict and become less reactive to it.
 
 Though initially conceptualized as an intervention for those with chronic anxiety and recurrent mood problems, ERT is also undergoing evaluation as a treatment for people experiencing expectedly high, continuous distress such as caregivers to loved ones with cancer.
 
 What Exactly Is ERT?
 
 ERT is a present-focused, structured psychotherapy that emphasizes awareness of emotions, acknowledgment of the conflict between desires for safety and value-guided action, creation of a healthy distance from harsh, critical thoughts about the self, and adoption of a more compassionate view of the self.
 
 Emotional awareness is developed through education about the purpose of feelings. The use of meditation exercises aimed to help reduce emotional avoidance—to improve tolerance of the presence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, emotions and sensations. Emotions are conceptualized as arising from within and reflecting competing motivations.
 
 From the ERT perspective, people with chronic anxiety and low mood worry a lot, ruminate, and look to others for reassurance as ways to avoid unpleasant feelings and feel more secure about themselves or their circumstance. At the same time, these individuals really want to behave in line with their particular life values. The motivational pulls of safety and reward may be experienced as conflicting with one another.
 
 Sometimes it is also hard to step far enough away from the worry or self-criticism to figure out the most rewarding course of action. In ERT, imagery, exposure, and internal role-play is practiced during and between sessions to help individuals establish a healthy distance from their negative, perpetually critical voice. During ERT role plays, the therapist facilitates a dialogue between the patient’s conflicting internal voices. The goal of this exercise is to be able to cope better with an internal, distressed voice while continuing to act in accordance with one's values.
 
 Overall, this type of therapy aims to help people who are stuck in their heads—ruminating, worrying, and so on—to return to the moment with increased awareness and ability to act with clarity towards identified goals.
 
 How Is It Different From Traditional CBT or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)?
 
 Unlike CBT, the cognitive work of ERT does not focus explicitly on labeling cognitive distortions. While there is a shared aim of enhancing awareness of one’s thought patterns and their impact on behavior, ERT stresses the development of compassionate self-talk over the overt weighing of evidence for and against a particular belief.
 
 ACT and ERT overlap in their goal of reducing the struggle to control or eliminate distressing emotions and enhancing proactive involvement in activities consistent with personal values. However, unlike ACT, ERT utilizes exposure- and behavioral-activation-based techniques during and between sessions in the latter phase of treatment.
 
 Who Provides ERT?
 
 An ERT therapist will be an active guide during a session. Clinicians who provide this type of psychotherapy receive specific training in it. The therapist could be a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or mental health counselor. Ask about your treatment provider’s training background to ensure that they are experienced with this technique.
 
 What Happens During an ERT Session?
 
 In the initial phase of ERT, the goals are to gain emotional awareness and tolerance and to begin to “catch yourself reacting” in the moment.
 
 Mindfulness of emotions is practiced routinely. Meditations are used, particularly to help people gain perspective on difficult moments, feelings, and beliefs.
 
 The latter phase of ERT integrates exposure and behavioral activation principles in and between sessions. Sessions, therefore, might include a worry exposure, guided imagery of a feared scenario with a desired coping response, or role-play exercises in which an individual hears from and talks to his or her “worry voice.”
 
 ERT therapists may start sessions with an imagery exercise. Written (and ultimately, behavioral) homework is commonly assigned and then reviewed in-session.
 
 More information about the ERT approach can be found on the website maintained by the treatment’s developers, Douglas Mennin, Ph.D. and David Fresco, Ph.D.

 By Lauren DiMaria 
 
  Medically reviewed by Steven Gans, MD Updated on February 25, 2020

 Dysthymia, also known as dysthymic disorder or DD, is a milder but chronic depressive disorder that is sometimes seen in children.
 
 The Course of Dysthymia
 
 Like other depressive disorders, the course of dysthymia varies in children. While the DSM-IV criteria require a child to experience symptoms for at least one year to be diagnosed with dysthymia, the median dysthymic episode for children is 3.9 years.
 
 Approximately 3 percent of children meet the criteria for dysthymia. However, some researchers argue that an even higher percentage of children have DD.
 
 The chronic nature of dysthymia makes it easy for parents to mistakenly attribute the symptoms to a child's personality.
 
 Children with DD may not complain of feeling depressed or sad because they do not recognize their mood as being different from what they normally feel.
 
 Symptoms
 
 Symptoms of DD are similar to those of major depressive disorder, but are less severe and are less likely to impair daily functioning.
 
 Symptoms of Dysthymic Disorder in Children
 
 Depressed mood
 
 Sadness
 
 Feelings of hopelessness and/or worthlessness
 
 Withdrawal from friends and family
 
 Low self-esteem
 
 Eating or sleeping pattern changes
 
 Unexplained physical ailments
 
 Lack of concentration
 
 Thoughts or action of self-harm or suicide
 
 Inability to experience pleasure or joy
 
 Irritability
 
 Restlessness or fatigue
 
 Despite the milder symptoms of dysthymia, it is still thought that its chronic nature may interfere with a child's development of interpersonal relationships, positive self-esteem, and problem-solving skills.
 
  Signs Your Child Is Depressed
 
 Recovery and Double Depression
 
 Recovery for children with dysthymia is likely. However, the majority of children will have another dysthymic episode in the future. Approximately 75 percent of children who experience a dysthymic episode will also experience a major depressive episode, a shorter but more severe depressive disorder.
 
 When a child who has dysthymia experiences a major depressive episode, the combination is called double depression.
 
 Factors that may increase a child's likelihood of developing double depression were identified by Dr. Daniel Klein and colleagues in a 10-year follow-up of children with dysthymia. Identified risk factors were:
 
 First dysthymic episode at a young age
 
 Co-existing anxiety disorder
 
 Strong family history of major depressive disorder
 
 Poor early relationship with mother
 
 History of sexual abuse
 
 Underlying personality disorder
 
 It has been noted that children with double depression may have shorter episodes of major depressive disorder. According to Dr. Kovacs and colleagues, this is because it is easier for a child to return to a baseline mood of dysthymia, or mild depressive symptoms, than a baseline with no presence of depressive symptoms. Nonetheless, all depressive disorders require treatment in children.
 
  What Parents Should Know About Childhood Depression
 
 Seeking Help
 
 Like other depressive disorders, dysthymic disorder is associated with serious short- and long-term consequences, such as poor academic and social performance, substance abuse, and increased risk of suicide.
 
 If you or your child are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911.
 
 For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database.
 
 Of course, not all children with dysthymia will experience negative outcomes, but given the association, treatment is recommended.
 
 Treatment options for children with dysthymia are typically psychotherapy, medication, or a combination approach.
 
 Be sure to talk to your child's pediatrician or other mental health providers if she has symptoms of dysthymia or another depressive disorder. Depressive disorders should never be left untreated in children.",,

1303,0,"Depression and anxiety: Exercise eases symptoms
 
 Depression and anxiety symptoms often improve with exercise. Here are some realistic tips to help you get started and stay motivated.
 
 By Mayo Clinic Staff
 
 When you have depression or anxiety, exercise often seems like the last thing you want to do. But once you get motivated, exercise can make a big difference.
 
 Exercise helps prevent and improve a number of health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis. Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the psychological and physical benefits of exercise can also help improve mood and reduce anxiety.
 
 The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear — but working out and other forms of physical activity can definitely ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise may also help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better.
 
 Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by:
 
 Releasing feel-good endorphins, natural cannabis-like brain chemicals (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of well-being
 
 Taking your mind off worries so you can get away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression and anxiety
 
 Regular exercise has many psychological and emotional benefits, too. It can help you:
 
 Gain confidence. Meeting exercise goals or challenges, even small ones, can boost your self-confidence. Getting in shape can also make you feel better about your appearance.
 
 Get more social interaction. Exercise and physical activity may give you the chance to meet or socialize with others. Just exchanging a friendly smile or greeting as you walk around your neighborhood can help your mood.
 
 Cope in a healthy way. Doing something positive to manage depression or anxiety is a healthy coping strategy. Trying to feel better by drinking alcohol, dwelling on how you feel, or hoping depression or anxiety will go away on its own can lead to worsening symptoms.
 
 Some research shows that physical activity such as regular walking — not just formal exercise programs — may help improve mood. Physical activity and exercise are not the same thing, but both are beneficial to your health.
 
 Physical activity is any activity that works your muscles and requires energy and can include work or household or leisure activities.
 
 Exercise is a planned, structured and repetitive body movement done to improve or maintain physical fitness.
 
 The word ""exercise"" may make you think of running laps around the gym. But exercise includes a wide range of activities that boost your activity level to help you feel better.
 
 Certainly running, lifting weights, playing basketball and other fitness activities that get your heart pumping can help. But so can physical activity such as gardening, washing your car, walking around the block or engaging in other less intense activities. Any physical activity that gets you off the couch and moving can help improve your mood.
 
 You don't have to do all your exercise or other physical activity at once. Broaden how you think of exercise and find ways to add small amounts of physical activity throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park a little farther away from work to fit in a short walk. Or, if you live close to your job, consider biking to work.
 
 Doing 30 minutes or more of exercise a day for three to five days a week may significantly improve depression or anxiety symptoms. But smaller amounts of physical activity — as little as 10 to 15 minutes at a time — may make a difference. It may take less time exercising to improve your mood when you do more-vigorous activities, such as running or bicycling.
 
 The mental health benefits of exercise and physical activity may last only if you stick with it over the long term — another good reason to focus on finding activities that you enjoy.
 
 Starting and sticking with an exercise routine or regular physical activity can be a challenge. These steps can help:
 
 Identify what you enjoy doing. Figure out what type of physical activities you're most likely to do, and think about when and how you'd be most likely to follow through. For instance, would you be more likely to do some gardening in the evening, start your day with a jog, or go for a bike ride or play basketball with your children after school? Do what you enjoy to help you stick with it.
 
 Get your mental health professional's support. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional for guidance and support. Discuss an exercise program or physical activity routine and how it fits into your overall treatment plan.
 
 Set reasonable goals. Your mission doesn't have to be walking for an hour five days a week. Think realistically about what you may be able to do and begin gradually. Tailor your plan to your own needs and abilities rather than setting unrealistic guidelines that you're unlikely to meet.
 
 Don't think of exercise or physical activity as a chore. If exercise is just another ""should"" in your life that you don't think you're living up to, you'll associate it with failure. Rather, look at your exercise or physical activity schedule the same way you look at your therapy sessions or medication — as one of the tools to help you get better.
 
 Analyze your barriers. Figure out what's stopping you from being physically active or exercising. If you feel self-conscious, for instance, you may want to exercise at home. If you stick to goals better with a partner, find a friend to work out with or who enjoys the same physical activities that you do. If you don't have money to spend on exercise gear, do something that's cost-free, such as regular walking. If you think about what's stopping you from being physically active or exercising, you can probably find an alternative solution.
 
 Prepare for setbacks and obstacles. Give yourself credit for every step in the right direction, no matter how small. If you skip exercise one day, that doesn't mean you can't maintain an exercise routine and might as well quit. Just try again the next day. Stick with it.
 
 Check with your doctor before starting a new exercise program to make sure it's safe for you. Talk to your doctor to find out which activities, how much exercise and what intensity level is OK for you. Your doctor will consider any medications you take and your health conditions. He or she may also have helpful advice about getting started and staying motivated.
 
 If you exercise regularly but depression or anxiety symptoms still interfere with your daily living, see your doctor or mental health professional. Exercise and physical activity are great ways to ease symptoms of depression or anxiety, but they aren't a substitute for talk therapy (psychotherapy) or medications.",,

 Migraine patients often have depression or anxiety.
 
 Depression and anxiety are worse when migraine attacks occur very often.
 
 When depression and anxiety are worse, more migraines are likely.
 
 Learning to recognize symptoms of depression and anxiety is helpful.
 
 Medications and therapy can help with depression and anxiety.
 
 Talk to your health care provider if you experience these symptoms.
 
 Migraine, Depression and Anxiety
 
 Many migraine patients suffer from symptoms of depression and anxiety. Migraine patients are between two to five times more likely to have these symptoms than patients without migraine. About 25% of patients with migraine have depression, and about 50% have anxiety. Some patients have symptoms of these disorders after living with migraine for years. Others develop them before migraine. At this time, scientists don’t know the exact answer why all are so common. One of the brain chemicals involved in all these conditions is called serotonin. Hormone changes in women can also trigger both conditions.
 
 Symptoms of depression and anxiety are most common among people with chronic migraine, which is when headache attacks occur on 15 or more days a month. For people with fewer headaches, depression or anxiety puts them at risk for more headaches over time. Symptoms of depression and anxiety also impact other areas of health. Migraine patients with depression or anxiety have higher medical costs, are at increased risk for suicide, and have higher levels of disability than migraine patients without depression or anxiety. Also, and perhaps most importantly, headache treatments don’t work as well when the depression or anxiety is not also being treated. Untreated patients are less likely to follow medicine or behavior treatment plans. They also show less response to headache medications, and are more likely to relapse. For these reasons, treating all these conditions is very important.
 
 Warning Symptoms—Especially Feelings and Thoughts
 
 Depression and anxiety treatment begins first with recognizing if you have symptoms. Both often appear as physical symptoms, some of which are similar to those seen in migraine. For example, problems with sleep and appetite changes, being easily upset, trouble concentrating, and low energy are all symptoms of migraine, depression, and anxiety. As a result, it is better to pay attention to thoughts and feelings. Depression usually involves strong feelings of sadness or hopelessness that last two weeks or more. Some migraine patients who are depressed do not feel sad or down, but are simply not as interested in activities that they normally enjoy. Others include feeling worthless, guilty, or thoughts of suicide.
 
 Anxiety Types
 
 Anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental disorder. 50-60% of migraine patients will suffer from an anxiety disorder. Most anxiety disorders involve chronic worry or fear and avoiding things that trigger these feelings. In panic disorder, the patient has recurrent, unexpected feelings of intense fear or terror that seem to come from out of the blue. The heart starts beating rapidly and breathing becomes strained. Other symptoms may involve sweating, fear of dying, or losing control. Although attacks don’t last very long and are not dangerous, many people develop significant anxiety between attacks and come to fear normal body sensations.
 
 Patients with generalized anxiety disorder can’t control their constant worry. They worry about life events that may never even happen. They are “worry warts” who often expect the worst possible outcome of every situation. Physical symptoms such as fatigue, trouble concentrating, and having tense muscles are common in these patients. Phobias are fears of specific objects or places, such as an intense fear of social interactions that causes the patient to avoid most social situations (social phobia). Physicians and mental health professionals assess these symptoms through interviews, surveys, and observing patient behavior.
 
 Treatment Options
 
 Many medications and therapies help with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Antidepressants reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety because they change how the brain sends chemical signals. Sometimes a single method can help both symptoms of depression/anxiety and headache. However, many patients require two different drugs or behavioral treatments for a period of time. They need one to treat depression/anxiety and another to prevent migraines.
 
 Behavioral therapies for depression require a commitment to changing behaviors that make depression worse. They often focus on getting involved in enjoyable or rewarding activities, knowing that if you force yourself to do these things your mood will improve over time. Changing thoughts about certain aspects of life can also be useful. Behavioral interventions for anxiety include safe and gradual exposure to the things that the patient fears. It too involves changing how the patient thinks about those things. Behavioral therapies are effective for depression, and tend to be more effective than medication for anxiety disorders, particularly for long-term relief. For many patients, combining medication and behavioral therapy is better than either one alone for depression, anxiety, and headache.
 
 Much work remains to help determine the best treatment options for different types of patients. We also need to better understand the impact that treating depression and anxiety has on headache. Remember, it is extremely important to obtain best treatment for each disorder: the depression or anxiety and the headache disorder. Safe and effective drug and behavioral therapies are available, so talk with your provider about any symptoms that you have.

 What causes depression?
 
 Depression is typically caused by one or more factors. This includes genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological causes.
 
 For example, depression may be caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. Sometimes there aren’t enough chemical messengers (called neurotransmitters) in the brain. Neurotransmitters that affect your mood are serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. A chemical imbalance in the brain may be caused by one or more of the following:
 
 Your genes. Sometimes depression is hereditary. This means it runs in your family. You may be more at risk for having depression if you have a parent or sibling who has depression.
 
 A medical condition. Problems with your thyroid or nutrient deficiencies may be associated with an increased risk of depression.
 
 Events in your life. Depression can be triggered by stressful events in your life. These can include the death of someone you love, a divorce, chronic illness, or loss of a job.
 
 Medicines, drugs, or alcohol. Taking certain medicines, abusing drugs or alcohol, or having other illnesses can also lead to depression.
 
 Depression is not caused by personal weakness, laziness, or lack of willpower.
 
 Can giving birth cause depression?
 
 In the days following the birth of a baby, it is common for some mothers to have mood swings. They may feel a little depressed or have a hard time concentrating. They may lose their appetite or find that they can’t sleep well even when the baby is asleep. This is called the baby blues and goes away within 10 days after delivery. However, some women have worse symptoms or symptoms that last longer. This is called postpartum depression.
 
 How is depression diagnosed?
 
 Tell your doctor about your symptoms. Don’t expect your doctor to guess that you’re depressed just by looking at you. You may feel embarrassed. It may be hard for you to imagine treatment will actually help you feel better. But don’t wait to talk to your doctor. The sooner you seek treatment, the sooner the depression will lift.
 
 Once you tell your doctor how you’re feeling, he or she may ask you some questions about your symptoms, your health, and your family history. Your doctor may also give you a physical exam and do some tests. It is important to tell your doctor about any medicines that you are taking.
 
 Reasons to get help early:
 
 Early diagnosis and treatment helps keep depression from getting worse or lasting a long time.
 
 Diagnosis and treatment can help you return to your “normal” self and enjoy life.
 
 Treatment can help prevent depression from coming back.
 
 Thoughts of suicide are common in people with major depression. The risk of suicide is higher the longer you wait to treat it. When depression is successfully treated, thoughts of suicide go away.
 
 Can depression be prevented or avoided?
 
 Generally, depression is a condition that cannot be prevented. There are lifestyle changes you can make that can boost your mood and minimize symptoms of depression (see depression treatment).
 
 Depression treatment
 
 Depression can be treated with medicines, with counseling, or with both. Lifestyle changes can help. This includes a nutritious diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol, drugs, and too much caffeine.
 
 Depression usually can be treated through visits to your doctor. You may need in-hospital treatment if you have other medical conditions that could affect your treatment. In-hospital treatment is required if you’re at high risk of suicide.
 
 Medicine
 
 Your doctor may prescribe medicine to treat your depression. These are called antidepressants. They help increase the number of chemical messengers (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) in your brain.
 
 Antidepressants work differently for different people. They also have different side effects. So, even if one medicine bothers you or doesn’t work for you, another may help. You may notice improvement as soon as 1 week after you start taking the medicine. But you probably won’t see the full effects for about 8 to 12 weeks. You may have side effects at first. They tend to decrease after a couple of weeks. Don’t stop taking the medicine without checking with your doctor first.
 
 Counseling
 
 Counseling may be a good treatment option for mild to moderate depression. For major depression and for some people with minor depression, counseling may not be enough. A combination of medicine and talk therapy is usually the most effective way of treating more severe depression. If you continue the combination treatment for at least a year, you are less likely to have depression come back.
 
 In psychotherapy, you talk with a trained therapist or counselor about things that are going on in your life. The focus may be on your thoughts and beliefs, on things that happened in your past, or on your relationships. Or the focus may be on your behavior, how it’s affecting you, and what you can do differently. Psychotherapy usually lasts for a limited time, such as 8 to 20 visits.
 
 In more serious cases, your doctor may suggest the use of electroconvulsive therapy (also called ECT or electroshock therapy). This is a procedure used to treat certain mental illnesses. Electric currents are passed through the brain in order to trigger a seizure (a short period of irregular brain activity). It lasts about 40 seconds. Medicine is given during ECT to prevent damage to muscles and bones.
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy may help people who have the following conditions:
 
 Severe depression that does not respond to antidepressants (medicines used to treat depression) or counseling.
 
 Severe depression in patients who can’t take antidepressants.
 
 Severe mania that does not respond to medicine. Symptoms of severe mania may include agitation, confusion, hallucinations, or delusions.
 
 Schizophrenia that does not respond to medicine.
 
 Living with depression
 
 The most important part of living with depression is not giving up. If you stay focused and are consistent with treatment, your mood will improve over time.
 
 Consider these dos and don’ts as you work toward recovery.
 
 Do:
 
 Pace yourself.
 
 Get involved in activities that make you feel good or feel like you’ve achieved something. This includes volunteering or joining a club.
 
 Avoid drugs and alcohol. Both make depression worse. Both can cause dangerous side effects with antidepressant medicines.
 
 Exercise regularly. It makes your body feel better. Exercise causes a chemical reaction in the body that can boost your mood. Your goal should be exercising 4 to 6 times a week for at least 30 minutes each time.
 
 Eat balanced meals and healthy foods. Avoid junk food and processed food.
 
 Get plenty of sleep. Keep your sleep routine consistent (waking up and going to bed at the same time each day).
 
 Take your medicine and/or go to counseling as often as your doctor recommends. Your medicine won’t work if you only take it occasionally.
 
 Set small goals for yourself if you have low energy.
 
 Encourage yourself.
 
 Get as much information as you can about depression and how to treat it.
 
 Call your doctor or the local suicide crisis center right away if you have thoughts of suicide.
 
 Don’t:
 
 Don’t isolate yourself. Stay in touch with friends, family, your spiritual advisor, and your doctor.
 
 Don’t let negative thoughts linger in your mind. Don’t talk badly about yourself. Don’t expect to fail. This type of thinking is typical of depression. These thoughts will go away as your depression lifts.
 
 Don’t blame yourself for your depression. You didn’t cause it.
 
 Don’t make major life decisions while you are depressed. This includes marriage, divorce, separation, quitting your job, etc. You may not be thinking clearly while you are depressed. If you must make an important decision, ask someone you trust to help you.
 
 Don’t expect to do everything you normally can. Set a realistic schedule.
 
 Don’t get discouraged. It will take time for your depression to lift fully. Be patient with yourself.
 
 Don’t give up.
 
 Complications
 
 People who have depression sometimes think about suicide. This thinking is a common symptom of the depression. If you have thoughts about hurting yourself, tell someone. Tell your doctor, your friends, or your family. Or you could call your local suicide hotline, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.
 
 Get help right away. There are people who can help you. Depression can be successfully treated.

1311,0,"What is persistent depressive disorder (PDD)?
 
 Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is chronic depression that lasts a long time. A person’s moods are generally affected for at least 2 years (1 year for children and adolescents). Their depression is usually mild or moderate, rather than severe. Most people who have PDD can’t recall when they first became depressed.
 
 PDD is a fairly common type of depression. It can begin in childhood or in adulthood. No one knows why. It appears to be more common in women. It used to be called dysthymic disorder or dysthymia.
 
 Symptoms of PDD
 
 The main symptom of PDD is a sad, low, or dark mood on most days. This lasts for at least 2 years. Children and teens with PDD can feel irritable instead of depressed. Their symptoms last for at least 1 year.
 
 Other symptoms that happen much of the time include:
 
 Poor appetite or overeating.
 
 Difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much.
 
 Low self-esteem.
 
 Poor concentration.
 
 Low energy.
 
 Fatigue.
 
 Feelings of hopelessness.
 
 Most people who have PDD may have an episode of major depression at least once in their lives.
 
 Older people who have PDD find it difficult to care for themselves. They feel isolated and have medical illnesses.
 
 People who have PDD may have periods of normal mood that can last up to 2 months. Family members and friends may not even know that their loved one is depressed. This type of depression is mild. It may be difficult for a person to function at home, school, or work.
 
 What causes PDD?
 
 No one knows what causes PDD. It may be related to some changes in the brain that involve a chemical called serotonin. Serotonin helps your brain handle emotions and make judgments. Other medical problems and ongoing life stress may also play a role.
 
 You may be at higher risk of developing PDD if you are a woman. It also tends to run in families. If a family member has it or another type of depression, you could be more likely to get it.
 
 How is PDD diagnosed?
 
 If you think you have PDD, discuss your concerns with your doctor. Your doctor will ask you questions to find out if you have depression and what type you have. Your doctor may ask you questions about your health and your symptoms. This may include how well you’re sleeping, if you feel tired a lot, and if you have trouble concentrating. Your doctor will also consider medical reasons that may cause you to feel depressed. These could be problems with your thyroid or a certain medicine you may be taking. He or she might order blood or urine tests to rule out these problems.
 
 Can PDD be prevented or avoided?
 
 In general, PDD and other forms of depression are conditions that cannot be prevented. There are lifestyle changes you can make that can boost your mood and minimize symptoms, including:
 
 Get enough sleep.
 
 Follow a healthy diet.
 
 Exercise.
 
 Reduce or avoid your alcohol consumption.
 
 Do not take illegal drugs.
 
 Take medicines as prescribed by your doctor.
 
 Watch for changes in your PDD. Talk to your doctor about changes.
 
 Engage in activities that bring you enjoyment.
 
 Talk to someone you trust about how you feel.
 
 Be around people who are positive and uplifting.
 
 PDD treatment
 
 PDD can be treated with an antidepressant medicine. This type of medicine helps relieve depression. Antidepressants don’t cause people to feel “high,” and they are not habit-forming.
 
 It may take weeks or months before you and your doctor know whether an antidepressant is helping you. It is important for you to take the medicine exactly as your doctor tells you. If the antidepressant helps you feel better, you may need to take this medicine for several years. You should continue to take the medicine, even if you begin to feel better. If you stop taking the medicine, you may get depressed again.
 
 Sometimes there are side effects from stopping antidepressant medicine suddenly. If you want to stop taking your medicine, talk to your doctor first. Your doctor can help you avoid side effects from stopping your medicine too quickly.
 
 Should I see a counselor too?
 
 Some patients find that counseling can help them deal with specific problems. It’s a safe place where you can talk about your thoughts and feelings. Many doctors believe that combining talk therapy with medicine is the most effective way to treat PDD and other types of depression.
 
 Living with PDD
 
 PDD is a chronic condition. It can last for many years. If you have PDD, there are things you can do to help yourself feel better. Talk to your doctor about how you’re feeling. Get treatment for your PDD. It may help to find activities that make you feel good or help you feel a sense of accomplishment.
 
 Go to a movie.
 
 Take a drive on a pleasant day.
 
 Go to a ball game.
 
 Work in the garden.
 
 Do something nice for someone else.
 
 Complications
 
 People with PDD sometimes experience episodes of major depression. This can make them think about suicide. If you have thoughts about hurting yourself or others, tell someone right away. You can tell your doctor, your family, or a friend. You can also call a suicide hotline. There may be a local number you can call. Or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.
 
 Get help right away. PDD and other forms of depression can be treated successfully.
 
 There is always someone who can help you.
 
 Questions to ask your doctor
 
 I’ve felt down for a long time. Could I have PDD?
 
 Do I need treatment? What are my treatment options?
 
 Should I see a counselor or someone else for talk therapy?
 
 Will I need medicine to treat my symptoms? How long will I need to take it?
 
 How is the treatment for PDD different than for major depression?
 
 What should I do if I find myself in a very dark place or start having thoughts of suicide?

 What is postpartum depression?
 
 Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mental health illness that affects women after giving birth. For some women, it is normal to feel the “baby blues” for a few weeks after giving birth. With postpartum depression, feelings of sadness, loneliness, worthlessness, restlessness, and anxiety last much longer than a few weeks.
 
 After having a baby, many women have mood swings. One minute they feel happy, and the next minute, they start to cry. They may feel a little depressed, have a hard time concentrating, lose their appetite, or find that they can’t sleep well, even when the baby is asleep. These symptoms usually start about 3 to 4 days after delivery and may last several days.
 
 If you’re a new mother and have any of these symptoms, you may have the baby blues. The baby blues are considered a normal part of early motherhood and usually go away within 10 days after delivery.
 
 Symptoms of postpartum depression
 
 The symptoms of postpartum depression affect your quality of life and include:
 
 Feeling sad or down often.
 
 Frequent crying or tearfulness.
 
 Feeling restless, irritable, or anxious.
 
 Loss of interest or pleasure in life.
 
 Loss of appetite.
 
 Less energy and motivation to do things.
 
 Difficulty sleeping, including trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, or sleeping more than usual.
 
 Feeling worthless, hopeless, or guilty.
 
 Unexplained weight loss or gain.
 
 Feeling like life isn’t worth living.
 
 Showing little interest in your baby.
 
 Not feeling attached to your baby.
 
 Although many women get depressed right after childbirth, some women don’t begin to feel depressed until several weeks or months later. Depression that occurs within 6 months of childbirth may be postpartum depression.
 
 In rare cases, a woman may develop postpartum psychosis. This is a very serious disease. It includes all the symptoms of postpartum depression, as well as thoughts of hurting yourself or hurting the baby.
 
 What causes postpartum depression?
 
 The exact cause isn’t known. Hormone levels change during pregnancy and right after childbirth. Those hormone changes may produce chemical changes in the brain. This plays a part in causing depression.
 
 Postpartum depression is more likely to occur if you have had any of the following:
 
 Previous postpartum depression.
 
 Depression not related to pregnancy.
 
 Severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
 
 A difficult or very stressful marriage or relationship.
 
 Few family members or friends to talk to or depend on.
 
 Stressful life events during pregnancy or after childbirth (such as severe illness during pregnancy, premature birth, or a difficult delivery).
 
 How is postpartum depression diagnosed?
 
 Schedule a visit with your doctor if you suspect you have postpartum depression. Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and feelings. He or she will ask you how long you have been feeling depressed. Your doctor may ask you to complete a questionnaire about your depression or order a blood test to check your hormone levels.
 
 Can postpartum depression be prevented or avoided?
 
 Postpartum depression cannot be prevented or avoided. However, if you have a history of depression or postpartum depression after giving birth to other children, you can prepare. Preparation might include keeping your mind and body healthy. Eat healthy during your pregnancy, exercise, and learn stress reduction strategies. Once you baby is born, stay away from alcohol and caffeine. Continue to make healthy lifestyle decisions. See your doctor earlier in your pregnancy or sooner after giving birth if you are worried you will have postpartum depression.
 
 Additionally, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends screening for depression in the general adult population. This includes pregnant and postpartum women. Screening efforts should focus on ensuring accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow up.
 
 Postpartum depression treatment
 
 Postpartum depression is treated much like any other depression. Support, counseling (talk therapy), and prescription medicines (antidepressants) can help. Talk with your doctor about what treatment is best for you. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby, get help immediately. Call a suicide hotline, a friend, family member, or 911.
 
 If you are breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of taking an antidepressant. Many antidepressant medicines are safe for breastfeeding infants. Your doctor can decide which medicine you can use while nursing your baby.
 
 Most importantly, don’t assume there’s nothing you can do if you are suffering from postpartum depression. Help is available, and you can get better.
 
 Living with postpartum depression
 
 Feeling depressed doesn’t mean that you are a bad person. It doesn’t mean that you did something wrong or that you brought this on yourself. It also does not mean that you don’t love your baby. If you have given birth recently and are feeling sad, blue, anxious, irritable, tired, or have any of the other symptoms of postpartum depression, remember that many other women have had the same experience.
 
 You’re not “losing your mind” or “going crazy.” You shouldn’t feel that you just have to suffer through it. Here are some things you can do that other mothers with postpartum depression have found helpful:
 
 Find someone to talk to and tell that person about your feelings.
 
 Get in touch with people who can help you with childcare, household chores, and errands. This support network will help you find time for yourself so you can rest.
 
 Find time to do something for yourself, even if it’s only 15 minutes a day. Try reading, exercising (walking is great for your health and is easy to do), taking a bath, or meditating.
 
 Keep a daily diary. Write down your emotions and feelings. This is a way to let out your thoughts and frustrations. Once you begin to feel better, you can go back and reread your diary. This will help you see how much better you are.
 
 Celebrate small achievements. Even if you can only get one thing done on any given day, remember that this is a step in the right direction. There may be days when you can’t get anything done. Try not to get angry with yourself when this happens.
 
 It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Childbirth brings many changes and parenting is challenging. When you’re not feeling like yourself, these changes can seem like too much to handle.
 
 You’re not expected to be a supermom. Be honest about how much you can do. Ask other people to help you when you need it.
 
 Find a support group in your area. They can put you in touch with people near you who have experience with postpartum depression.
 
 Talk with your doctor about how you feel. He or she may offer counseling and/or medicines that can help.
 
 Questions to ask your doctor
 
 Will I have to take antidepressants for life?
 
 If I take medicine, will I have trouble getting off the medicine when I feel better?
 
 How will I know if the medicine is making me feel better or if I’m naturally getting better?
 
 Will I have postpartum depression with every pregnancy?
 
 Who should I call if I am having thoughts of suicide or of harming my baby?

 Summary
 
 What is self-harm?
 
 Self-harm, or self-injury, is when a person hurts his or her own body on purpose. The injuries may be minor, but sometimes they can be severe. They may leave permanent scars or cause serious health problems. Some examples are
 
 Cutting yourself (such as using a razor blade, knife, or other sharp object to cut your skin)
 
 Punching yourself or punching things (like a wall)
 
 Burning yourself with cigarettes, matches, or candles
 
 Pulling out your hair
 
 Poking objects through body openings
 
 Breaking your bones or bruising yourself
 
 Self-harm is not a mental disorder. It is a behavior - an unhealthy way to cope with strong feelings. However, some of the people who harm themselves do have a mental disorder.
 
 People who harm themselves are usually not trying to kill themselves. But they are at higher risk of attempting suicide if they do not get help.
 
 Why do people harm themselves?
 
 There are different reasons why people harm themselves. Often, they have trouble coping and dealing with their feelings. They harm themselves to try to
 
 Make themselves feel something, when they feel empty or numb inside
 
 Block upsetting memories
 
 Show that they need help
 
 Release strong feelings that overwhelm them, such as anger, loneliness, or hopelessness
 
 Punish themselves
 
 Feel a sense of control
 
 Who is at risk for self-harm?
 
 There are people of all ages who harm themselves, but it usually starts in the teen or early adult years. Self-harm is more common in people who
 
 Were abused or went through a trauma as children
 
 Have mental disorders, such as
 
 Depression
 
 Eating disorders
 
 Post-traumatic stress disorder
 
 Certain personality disorders
 
 Misuse drugs or alcohol
 
 Have friends who self-harm
 
 Have low self-esteem
 
 What are the signs of self-harm?
 
 Signs that someone may be hurting themselves include
 
 Having frequent cuts, bruises, or scars
 
 Wearing long sleeves or pants even in hot weather
 
 Making excuses about injuries
 
 Having sharp objects around for no clear reason
 
 How can I help someone who self-harms?
 
 If someone you know is self-harming, it is important not to be judgmental. Let that person know that you want to help. If the person is a child or teenager, ask him or her to talk to a trusted adult. If he or she won't do that, talk to a trusted adult yourself. If the person who is self-harming is an adult, suggest mental health counseling.
 
 What the treatments are for self-harm?
 
 There are no medicines to treat self-harming behaviors. But there are medicines to treat any mental disorders that the person may have, such as anxiety and depression. Treating the mental disorder may weaken the urge to self-harm.
 
 Mental health counseling or therapy can also help by teaching the person
 
 Problem-solving skills
 
 New ways to cope with strong emotions
 
 Better relationship skills
 
 Ways to strengthen self-esteem
 
 If the problem is severe, the person may need more intensive treatment in a psychiatric hospital or a mental health day program.

 Summary
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes with the seasons. It usually starts in the late fall and early winter and goes away during the spring and summer. Some people do have episodes of depression that start in the spring or summer, but that is a lot less common. Symptoms of SAD may include
 
 Sadness
 
 Gloomy outlook
 
 Feeling hopeless, worthless, and irritable
 
 Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy
 
 Low energy
 
 Difficulty sleeping or oversleeping
 
 Carbohydrate cravings and weight gain
 
 Thoughts of death or suicide
 
 SAD is more common in women, young people, and those who live far from the equator. You are also more likely to have SAD if you or your family members have depression.
 
 The exact causes of SAD are unknown. Researchers have found that people with SAD may have an imbalance of serotonin, a brain chemical that affects your mood. Their bodies also make too much melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep, and not enough vitamin D.
 
 The main treatment for SAD is light therapy. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the sunshine that you miss during the fall and winter months. You sit in front of a light therapy box every morning to get daily exposure to bright, artificial light. But some people with SAD do not respond to light therapy alone. Antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can reduce SAD symptoms, either alone or combined with light therapy.",,

 While seasonal depression is usually associated with the winter, some people find their symptoms peak in spring. This year, the arrival of sunnier days may pose more challenges than normal.

 Most of us are familiar with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that usually worsens over the winter months. Faced with short days, long nights, and grey skies, SAD sufferers find themselves struggling with low mood and other depressive symptoms. Although the causes aren't fully understood, this condition has been linked to lack of sunlight and its impact on your circadian rhythms.
 
 Unfortunately, the onset of warmer days doesn't bring reprieve for everyone. Some people suffer from a different form of seasonal depression, which peaks over the spring and summer. Sometimes called 'reverse SAD' or 'summer SAD', this may be all the harder to bear for being poorly understood. After all, many people can relate to feeling miserable in winter - but a summer-related depression can be truly isolating.
 
 What causes springtime depression?
 
 ""We're still not sure what causes it, but it's thought that the increased heat and humidity in spring and summer can play a role for some people,"" says Dr Elena Touroni, a consultant psychologist and co-founder of The Chelsea Psychology Clinic. ""But also added pressures of having fun in summer can be a trigger. When the sun's out and everyone's busy socialising, it can make someone feel lacking in some way if they don't feel the same way.""
 
 Some people may experience disrupted sleep as it gets hotter and lighter - a big factor in depression - while others may grapple with body image difficulties.
 
 Another factor can be seasonal allergies, which are associated with depression and other mood disorders. Some researchers have speculated that this may be due to inflammation. When you have an allergic reaction to pollen, chemicals called cytokines pool in the airways, and can affect the way the brain functions.
 
 Sadly, suicide rates tend to peak in the spring and summer, rather than the winter - a surprising pattern that holds true across multiple studies. Researchers don't know exactly why this might be. But it goes to show that springtime depression should be taken seriously. Depressive symptoms aren't likely to dispel just because it's a sunny day.
 
 Is it SAD or is it depression?
 
 So how do you know if you have reverse SAD, as opposed to depression that just happens to occur in spring? Dr Touroni doesn't think the distinction is that important.
 
 ""I think the focus should be less about viewing conditions as 'real' or not, but more about trying to uncover the reasons why someone might be feeling this way. Otherwise, we run the risk of stigmatising someone's emotional experience,"" she says.
 
 She adds that, while this past year has been difficult for all of us, it's important not to sweep any symptoms of depression under the carpet.
 
 ""We're all likely to have felt a rollercoaster of emotions, but these changes in mood are generally more short-term,"" she says. ""Signs to look out for would be any changes that you notice during a longer period of time. Sleeping difficulties, an increase in anxiety levels, feeling more irritable, low mood or no longer finding enjoyment in the things that once brought you pleasure are all warning signs to look out for.""

 Extra challenges this spring
 
 If you're prone to springtime depression anyway, this year may pose even more challenges than usual. As the UK begins its gradual route out of lockdown, there will be a lot of rhetoric around resuming life as normal. Some people may feel pressurised by this messaging, or may continue to feel that the world is a treacherous, unsafe place.
 
 During lockdown, we had a sense that everyone was having a tough time, and that if you were feeling low that was normal. As we emerge, there may be a perception that everyone else is having fun, which could be especially detrimental if you're still struggling.
 
 ""We went into lockdown with the understanding that it was protecting us from harm,"" says Dr Touroni. ""For those with underlying health conditions, or for those who struggle with anxiety, it might take a while for them to feel safe in the world again. It will be about finding a balance between not pushing yourself prematurely but also not allowing any amplified sense of fear hold you back from living life to the fullest.""
 
 What to do if you're struggling
 
 Rest assured - you won't be the only one dealing with mental health challenges this spring. And if you're experiencing any of the telltale signs of depression or anxiety, it's important to recognise there's help available.
 
 You can begin by speaking with your GP (likely via phone consultation), who can refer you on to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) if appropriate, or may prescribe medication. You can also refer yourself for NHS counselling, or seek out a private therapist. Some appointments will be conducted over video call for the time being, whereas others may be available face-to-face.
 
 ""I would encourage anyone in this position to reach out for help as soon as possible. The sooner you get the right help, the faster your chances of making a speedy recovery,"" says Dr Touroni.",,

 In a world where so much pressure is put on physical appearance, having acne can seriously affect self-esteem and confidence - and in some cases, it can lead to mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.
 
 Emma*, 23, has had acne for more than a decade but says her skin deteriorated after she came off the contraceptive pill aged 21.
 
 ""It's unbearably frustrating to imagine the things I've allowed myself to miss out on as a result of my skin,"" she says. ""I've cancelled dates, missed job interviews, called in sick to work and even avoided spending time with my own family because I feared their judgement. The anxiety, shame and constant emphasis on panicking that people are staring at my spots is relentlessly overwhelming.
 
 ""My skin has caused me such sadness throughout my life that I've considered taking my own life on more than one occasion,"" Emma says.
 
 ""It affects everything I do. From not being able to shower at the gym because people will see me without make-up on, to refusing to go on holiday with friends because they’ll have to see me before bed.""
 
 Why acne affects mental health
 
 As a visible skin condition, acne can have a profound impact on mental health, confidence and self-worth. In early 2018, research published in the British Journal of Dermatology found patients with acne had an increased risk of developing major depression. A separate British Skin Foundation study of 2,299 people with acne found more than 20% of respondents reported to have thought about - or attempted - suicide.
 
 Spots are often dismissed as a minor skin condition, but acne can impact all aspects of life, including relationships, friendships and work. A recent survey by the British Association of Dermatologists found 22% of British adults with acne say the condition has negatively impacted their social interactions.
 
 ""As an adult with acne, spots continue to evoke shame, embarrassment and feelings of inadequacy,"" says Dr Anjali Mahto, a consultant dermatologist at Skin55 and the author of The Skincare Bible.
 
 ""It also generates anger: I should have grown out of this by now! These are the same sentiments I hear being echoed by my patients in clinic on a daily basis.
 
 “It can be incredibly frustrating when it's back yet again after a round of what you thought was a successful treatment, but the reality is that it is often a condition that requires control rather than being amenable to a permanent cure,"" Mahto adds.
 
 ""Acne is much easier to come to terms with when we realise that our real goal should be to minimise its impacts so that we can get on with life. If it comes back, worry not; there are ways we can deal with it, and we needn't let it hold us back.""
 
 The treatment of acne depends on how severe it is - and although it might take a few months to improve, it's important to remember there is help and support out there.

 Best skincare for acne
 
 According to Mahto, the right skincare regime with the correct ingredients is the most effective way to manage acne concerns.
 
 ""I would advise staying away from using facial oils, cleansers and thick creamy textures in products,"" she says.
 
 ""Stick to light or gel-like formulations. Ideally the product should be labelled as non-comedogenic: whilst this is not a guarantee the product will not make you break out, it is better than a product that is not labelled at all! Look for ingredients such as retinol, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, zinc, tea tree oil, benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, lactobionic acid and retinyl palmitate.""

 Lifestyle changes
 
 Mahto also recommends following a nutritious diet with lots of whole grains, vegetables and pulses.
 
 ""Stress can anecdotally also play a part in aggravating inflammatory skin conditions such as acne,"" she says. ""Learn to de-stress and make sure you get enough sleep and exercise. Participate in activities such as yoga and meditation if this works for you.""
 
 When to see your GP
 
 If your acne is more widespread or severe, your GP can advise what the best treatment is for you. They may recommend topical medications or antibiotics, or a combination of both.
 
 In severe cases, other medication may be prescribed, such as isotretinoin - which is sometimes used when acne is resistant to other treatments. As with all medications, there is a risk of side effects. Research has linked the medication to areas of the brain associated with depression, so you should tell your GP if you feel depressed or anxious.
 
 Hormonal therapies
 
 Hormonal therapies may help women with acne, particularly if it is exacerbated by periods or conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.
 
 Your GP may suggest taking the combined oral contraceptive pill, although this can take up to a year to improve acne.
 
 Psychodermatology
 
 Psychodermatology is a field of research which studies the link between emotional issues and skin conditions and provides psychological support - such as cognitive behavioural therapy - alongside dermatological treatments.
 
 Matthew Gass, of the British Association of Dermatologists, explains: ""Psychodermatology is the treatment of skin disease using psychological techniques. It is typically used to complement other physical therapies that directly treat the cause or symptoms of skin disease.
 
 ""Although different people react differently, acne can make people feel more self-conscious, and socially anxious, and can lower self-esteem and increase social isolation. Psychodermatology techniques can be helpful in managing these feelings and can help us change the way we think about ourselves. For example, when it comes to building self-confidence it is key to start recognising the negative patterns that evoke feelings of doubt, anxiety and shyness.”
 
 You can find out more about accessing support via Psychodermatology UK.
 
 Finding support
 
 There are organisations which provide advice and support for people struggling with their mental health because of acne, such as Acne Support, a programme recently launched by the British Association of Dermatologists.
 
 The charity Mind & Skin aims to help raise self-esteem, reduce stress and help manage the psychological aspects of acne.

1379,0,"Is your PMS depression really PMDD?
 
 Premenstrual syndrome is something many women are familiar with. From painful cramps and mood swings, lots of people experience PMS - but for some, the symptoms are debilitating. Around one in 20 women have symptoms severe enough to stop them living their normal lives, which can be the result of premenstrual dysphoric disorder - or PMDD - which can have a serious impact on mental well-being.

 Olive Mackintosh-Lowe, 26, says her PMDD causes depression, lethargy and mood swings in the two weeks before her period.
 
 ""At its worst, it has led to the breakdown of a loving relationship; it has caused me to spend days unable to get out of bed to work or even to do smaller things like brush my hair,"" she says.
 
 ""I would be overwhelmed with despair as if my heart had been filled up with cement. For me, the mood swings are certainly the worst but there are many people who suffer physically or experience completely different symptoms around their period.
 
 ""The mood swings were how I spotted something was wrong - I am a passionate person but it is rare that I experience real rage,"" Mackintosh-Lowe adds. ""However, without medication, I can be happily pottering through my day one minute and be consumed with a visceral, righteous anger the next.""
 
 What is PMDD?
 
 Nick Panay, spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and chair of the National Association for Premenstrual Syndrome, says PMDD is a 'severe' form of PMS and affects 5-10% of women.
 
 ""The symptoms of PMDD are similar to those of PMS, but are more exaggerated and often have more psychological symptoms than physical ones. These can include feelings of hopelessness, persistent sadness or depression, extreme anger and anxiety, decreased interest in usual activities, sleeping much more or less than usual, very low self-esteem and extreme tension and irritability,"" he says.
 
 ""PMDD and severe PMS can have a profoundly negative effect on a woman's daily life. It is diagnosed when mood symptoms seriously affect relationships and stop women from functioning properly in their daily lives.""

 Is it PMDD?
 
 Panay says that while it's normal for a woman to experience mild PMS symptoms, such as feeling upset, irritable or tired, you should see your GP if the symptoms are making everyday life difficult.
 
 It can be helpful to take the PMDD treatment guidelines with you to your GP appointment. You can download guidelines from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the National Association for Premenstrual Syndrome (NAPS), which explain what the condition is and treatment options.
 
 Sometimes people with PMDD can be wrongly diagnosed with other mental health problems such as depression because they share some of the same symptoms. It can also be helpful to ask to speak with a doctor who specialises in gynaecology or mental health.
 
 What can help
 
 Keep a symptom diary
 
 Dr Shazia Malik, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, recommends keeping a symptom diary.
 
 ""The first step is to keep a diary of your symptoms over two-three menstrual cycles - often getting the diagnosis can be the biggest hurdle. Once other causes for your symptoms have been ruled out, you should see a specialist who can help with specific symptoms,"" she says.
 
 Medication
 
 Your GP may recommend medication to treat feelings of depression.
 
 ""Finding the right medication has given me some relief from these awful symptoms but I had to drive my treatment every step of the way,"" Mackintosh-Lowe says.
 
 Hormonal treatments
 
 Your GP may also recommend taking the pill - oral contraceptives - to help reduce the symptoms of PMDD by controlling or stopping your periods.
 
 Although this helps some people, though, it may not necessarily work for everyone. Taking the pill may make some people's symptoms worse.
 
 Some people may benefit from gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, which come as injections or a nasal spray and reduce the symptoms of PMDD by bringing on a temporary menopause.
 
 Side effects include loss of bone density, which can lead to osteoporosis (weak or brittle bones), so treatment is often combined with hormone replacement therapy - which relieves symptoms of the menopause and reduces bone density loss.
 
 In very severe cases and when all other treatment options have been exhausted, your GP may talk to you about surgeries such as a hysterectomy. This involves the removal of the uterus, which carries risks and is non-reversible.
 
 Lifestyle changes
 
 Making some lifestyle changes can sometimes help improve your mental and physical health generally, which may help with the symptoms of PMDD.
 
 Getting regular exercise can help because physical activity releases brain chemicals such as endorphins, which help boost our mood. A 2017 study by the Black Dog Institute found regular exercise can help prevent depression - and just one hour a week can help. Exercising can also help you sleep better too.
 
 The charity Mind also recommends eating a healthy, balanced diet, reducing the amount of alcohol you drink, quitting smoking and reducing your caffeine intake too.
 
 Emotional care
 
 Self-care may help reduce the impact PMDD has on your life. You could try to manage your stress levels with relaxation techniques, such as yoga, meditation or mindfulness, which can help with unwanted thoughts.
 
 Know your cycle
 
 It can help to know your cycle, including dates and common feelings or thoughts. Mind recommends rearranging stressful events for different times, planning relaxing activities and even creating a self-care box.
 
 A self-care box contains things which help you through difficult periods, such as your favourite book, photographs, mindfulness colouring books and other items.
 
 Talking treatments
 
 Your doctor may recommend talking treatments to help manage the psychological symptoms of PMDD, such as depression and anxiety. Talking therapies give you a safe space to speak to a professional without judgement and may help you make more sense of things.
 
 Talk to someone
 
 Reproductive health and mental health should never been seen as taboo subjects and it's important to speak with other people if you are struggling.
 
 Speaking to someone, whether it's a friend, family member or your GP, is often the first step you can take towards getting help.
 
 Peer support can help alleviate feelings of isolation by connecting you with other people who have experienced PMDD.
 
 The International Association for Premenstrual Disorders (IAPMD) provides more information about online peer support available for women with PMDD around the world, including links to online groups. You could also try Mind's Elefriends community, an online space for people with mental health problems.

 Dealing With Depression
 
 Depression is common. Symptoms can affect day-to-day life and can become very distressing. Treatments include talking (psychological) treatments and antidepressant medicines. Treatment takes time to work but has a good chance of success. Some people have repeated episodes of depression and require long-term treatment to keep symptoms away.

 Depression symptoms
 
 Many people know when they are depressed. However, some people do not realise when they are depressed. They may know that they are not right and are not functioning well but don't know why. Some people might think that they have a physical illness - for example, if they lose weight. However physical symptoms can be caused by depression.
 
 There is a set of symptoms that are associated with depression and help to clarify the diagnosis. These are:
 
 Core symptoms
 
 Persistent sadness or low mood. This may be with, or without, a tendency to cry.
 
 Marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities, even for activities that you normally enjoy.
 
 Other common symptoms
 
 Disturbed sleep compared with your usual pattern. This may be difficulty in getting off to sleep, or waking early and being unable to get back to sleep. Sometimes it is sleeping too much.
 
 Change in appetite. This is often a poor appetite and weight loss. Sometimes the reverse happens with comfort eating and weight gain.
 
 Tiredness (fatigue), or loss of energy.
 
 Agitation or slowing of movements.
 
 Poor concentration or indecisiveness. For example, you may find it difficult to read, work, etc. Even simple tasks can seem difficult.
 
 Feelings of worthlessness, or excessive or inappropriate guilt.
 
 Recurrent thoughts of death. This is not usually a fear of death, more a preoccupation with death and dying. For some people despairing thoughts such as ""life's not worth living"" or ""I don't care if I don't wake up"" are common. Sometimes these thoughts progress into thoughts about, and even plans for, suicide.
 
 An episode of depression is usually diagnosed if:
 
 You have at least five out of the above nine symptoms, with at least one of these a core symptom and:
 
 Symptoms cause you distress or impair your normal functioning, such as affecting your work performance; and
 
 Symptoms occur most of the time on most days and have lasted at least two weeks; and
 
 The symptoms are not due to a medication side-effect, or to drug or alcohol misuse, or to a physical condition such as an underactive thyroid or pituitary gland. (However, see section later: 'Depression and physical conditions'.)
 
 Many people with depression say that their symptoms are often worse first thing each day. Also with depression, it is common to develop physical symptoms such as headaches, the sensation of having a 'thumping' heart (palpitations), chest pains and general aches. Some people consult a doctor at first because they have a physical symptom such as chest pains. They are concerned that they may have a physical problem such as a heart condition when it is actually due to depression. Depression is in fact quite a common cause of physical symptoms. But, the opposite is also true. That is, people with serious physical conditions are more likely than average to develop depression.
 
 Some people with severe depression also develop delusions and/or hallucinations. These are called psychotic symptoms. A delusion is a false belief that a person has, and most people from the same culture would agree that it is wrong. For example, a belief that people are plotting to kill you or that there is a conspiracy about you. Hallucination means hearing, seeing, feeling, smelling, or tasting something that is not real.

 What is depression?
 
 Prof Swaran Singh
 
 The word depressed is a common everyday word. People might say ""I'm depressed"" when in fact they mean ""I'm fed up because I've had a row, or failed an exam, or lost my job"", etc. These ups and downs of life are common and normal. Most people recover quite quickly. With true depression, you have a low mood and other symptoms each day for at least two weeks. Symptoms can also become severe enough to interfere with normal day-to-day activities.

 Who has depression?
 
 About 5 in 100 adults have depression every year. Sometimes it is mild or lasts just a few weeks. However, an episode of depression serious enough to require treatment occurs in about 1 in 4 women and 1 in 10 men at some point in their lives. Some people have two or more episodes of depression at various times in their lives.

 Severity of depression
 
 The severity of depression can vary from person to person. Severity is generally divided as follows:
 
 Severe depression - you would normally have most or all of the nine symptoms listed above. Also, symptoms markedly interfere with your normal functioning.
 
 Moderate depression - you would normally have more than the five symptoms that are needed to make the diagnosis of depression. Also, symptoms will usually include both core symptoms. Also, the severity of symptoms or impairment of your functioning is between mild and severe.
 
 Mild depression - you would normally have five of the symptoms listed above that are required to make the diagnosis of depression. However, you are not likely to have more than five or six of the symptoms. Also, your normal functioning is only mildly impaired.
 
 Subthreshold depression - you have fewer than the five symptoms needed to make a diagnosis of depression. So, it is not classed as depression. But, the symptoms you do have are troublesome and cause distress. If this situation persists for more than two years it is sometimes called dysthymia.
 
 What causes depression?
 
 The exact cause is not known. Anyone can develop depression. Some people are more prone to it and it can develop for no apparent reason. You may have no particular problem or worry, but symptoms can develop quite suddenly. So, there may be some genetic factor involved that makes some people more prone than others to depression. 'Genetic' means that the condition is passed on through families.
 
 An episode of depression may also be triggered by a life event such as a relationship problem, bereavement, redundancy, illness, etc. In many people it is a mixture of the two. For example, the combination of a mild low mood with some life problem, such as work stress, may lead to a spiral down into depression.
 
 Women tend to develop depression more often than men. Particularly common times for women to become depressed are after childbirth (postnatal depression) and the menopause.

 Depression and physical conditions
 
 Although the cause of depression is not clear, there are some useful things to remember about depression in relation to physical conditions.
 
 Depression is more common in people who are known to have certain physical conditions.
 
 The diagnosis of depression is sometimes confused with some undiagnosed diseases caused by physical conditions.
 
 Known physical conditions
 
 Depression is more common than average in people coping with serious or severe physical diseases. Although the treatment of the physical disease may take priority, the treatment of depression is also useful to improve overall well-being.
 
 Undiagnosed physical conditions
 
 Various physical conditions may at first seem to mimic depression. Doctors aim to be on the lookout for these diseases and may order tests to rule them out if one is suspected. Perhaps the most common examples are:
 
 An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) - can make you feel quite low, weepy and tired. A blood test can diagnose this.
 
 An underactive pituitary gland (hypopituitarism) - the pituitary gland is just under the brain. It makes various hormones which have various actions. Sometimes one hormone can be deficient; sometimes more than one. There are various symptoms that can develop. These include loss of sex drive, sexual problems, infertility, uncontrollable weight gain and feeling low, depressed and even suicidal. Blood tests can help to diagnose hypopituitarism. There are various causes of hypopituitarism, including head injury.
 
 Head injury - even a relatively mild one, even many years ago. For example, studies have shown that rates of suicide (presumably related to depression) are more common than average in people who have previously had a head injury. The reason for this is not fully understood. However, one factor that may be significant in some cases is that a head injury may result in hypopituitarism, as discussed above.
 
 Polymyalgia rheumatica - this condition mainly affects older people. Typical symptoms include stiffness, pain, aching, feeling depressed and tenderness of the large muscles around the shoulders and upper arms. Feeling depressed can be the first main symptom before the other symptoms predominate.
 
 Early dementia - is sometimes confused with depression.
 
 Certain medicines - both prescribed and street (illicit) drugs - can cause side-effects which may mimic depression.
 
 The rest of this leaflet is about depression of unknown cause that is not associated with any physical condition.
 
 What are the treatment options for depression?
 
 In general, treatments are divided into those used for mild depression and those used for moderate and severe depression.
 
 What if I don't have any treatment?
 
 Most people with depression will get better without treatment. However, this may take several months or even longer. (The average length of an episode of depression is 6-8 months.) Meanwhile, living with depression can be difficult and distressing (and also for your family and friends). Relationships, employment, etc, may be seriously affected. There is also a danger that some people turn to alcohol or illegal drugs. Some people think of suicide. Therefore, many people with depression opt for treatment.

 Treatment options for mild depression
 
 The following are the commonly used treatment options for people with mild depression. They are also used for people with long-standing subthreshold depression that has shown no signs of improving. Some people prefer one type of treatment to another. So, personal preference for the type of treatment used should be taken into account when discussing the best treatment for yourself with your doctor.
 
 A guided self-help programme
 
 There are various pamphlets, books and CDs which can help you to understand and combat depression. The best are based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Ideally, a guided self-help programme is best. That is, a programme where the materials are provided by a trained practitioner such as a doctor and where a practitioner monitors your progress. A self-help programme takes some motivation and effort to work through - a bit like doing homework. A typical guided self-help programme consists of 6-8 sessions (face-to-face and via telephone) over 9-12 weeks.
 
 Computer-based CBT
 
 Computer- and internet-based self-help CBT programmes are recent innovations. They are supported by a trained practitioner who monitors progress. A programme typically takes place over 9-12 weeks and you are given tasks to try out between sessions.
 
 Group-based CBT
 
 This is CBT but in a group setting of 8-10 participants. Typically, it consists of 10-12 weekly meetings.
 
 Group-based peer support
 
 This is an option for people with depression who also have an ongoing (chronic) physical problem. This allows sharing of experiences and feelings with a group of people who understand the difficulties and issues facing group members. Typically, it consists of one session per week over 8-12 weeks. Ideally, it should be supported by a facilitator who has knowledge of the physical health problem and reviews progress with people taking part in the group.
 
 See the separate leaflet called Dealing with Depression.
 
 Antidepressant medicines
 
 Antidepressant medication is not usually recommended for the initial treatment of mild depression. However, an antidepressant may be advised for mild depression in certain circumstances. For example, in people:
 
 With mild depression that persists after other treatments have not helped.
 
 Whose depression is associated with a physical illness.
 
 Who have had an episode of moderate or severe depression in the past.
 
 Second-line treatment
 
 For mild depression, the above treatments often work well and symptoms improve. However, if symptoms do not improve much with the above treatments, it is usual to move on to treatments usually advised for moderate or severe depression, as discussed earlier. That is, an antidepressant and a more intensive psychological treatment such as individual one-to-one CBT.
 
 Treatment options for moderate or severe depression
 
 Antidepressant medicines
 
 Antidepressant medicines are commonly used to treat moderate or severe depression. A medicine cannot alter your circumstances. However, symptoms such as low mood, poor sleep, poor concentration, etc, are often eased with an antidepressant. This may then allow you to function more normally and increase your ability to deal with any problems or difficult circumstances. See the separate leaflet called Antidepressants.
 
 Psychological (talking) treatments
 
 Various psychological treatments have been shown in research trials to be good treatments for depression. These are briefly listed below. In general, a combination of an antidepressant plus a psychological treatment is thought to be better than either treatment alone. However, further research is required to work out the best option. Typically, most psychological treatments for depression last in the range of 12-20 weekly sessions of 1-2 hours per session.
 
 Those most commonly used for moderate or severe depression are:
 
 Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive therapy is based on the idea that certain ways of thinking can trigger, or fuel, certain mental health problems such as depression.
 
 Interpersonal therapy (IPT). This is sometimes offered instead of CBT. IPT is based on the idea that your personal relationships may play a large role in affecting your mood and mental state. The therapist helps you to change your thinking and behaviour and improve your interaction with others. For example, IPT may focus on issues such as bereavement or disputes with others that may be contributing to the depression.
 
 Other types of therapy sometimes used, depending on circumstances, include:
 
 Behavioural activation. The basis of this therapy is that behaviours such as inactivity and ruminating on certain thoughts can be key factors in maintaining depression. The therapist aims to help you to combat these unhelpful behaviours.
 
 Couple therapy. This may be an option for people who have a regular partner and where the relationship contributes to the depression. Or, where involving the partner is considered to be of potential useful benefit.
 
 Other treatments
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be advised as a last resort if you have severe depression which has not improved with other treatments.
 
 What about exercise?
 
 It is difficult to give firm advice about exercise as a treatment. Some people claim that regular exercise helps to lift their mood and combat depression. But, there is conflicting evidence about this from research trials. The national guideline published in 2009 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and updated in 2016 advises regular exercise as a possible treatment. A large review published in 2012 supports this advice. It concluded that exercise, on average, seems to improve depressive symptoms. In contrast, a large research trial published in 2012 found that addition of an exercise programme to the usual care for depression neither improved the depression outcome nor reduced the antidepressant use compared with usual care alone.
 
 But also bear in mind that regular exercise is generally a good thing to do anyway. See the separate leaflet called Exercise and Physical Activity.
 
 Some myths about depression
 
 Depression is common but many people don't admit to it. Some people feel there is a stigma attached, or that people will think they are weak.
 
 Great leaders such as Winston Churchill have had depression. Depression is one of the most common illnesses that GPs deal with. People with depression may be told by others to ""pull their socks up"" or ""snap out of it"". The truth is, they cannot and such comments by others are very unhelpful.
 
 St John's wort
 
 This is not advised. St John's wort (hypericum) is a herbal antidepressant that you can buy, without a prescription, from pharmacies. It became a popular treatment for depression. However, national guidelines for depression do not advise that you take this because:
 
 It is not clear how well it works. Although some studies suggest that it may help depression, other studies have failed to confirm this.
 
 Side-effects sometimes occur. (Some people think that because St John's wort is 'natural' then it is totally safe. This is not true. It contains many chemicals which sometimes cause problems.)
 
 It may react with other medicines that you may take. Sometimes the reactions can cause serious problems. For example, you should not take St John's wort if you are taking warfarin, ciclosporin, oral contraceptives, anticonvulsants, digoxin, theophylline, or certain anti-HIV medicines. Also, you should not take it at the same time as certain other prescribed antidepressants.
 
 Possible new treatments
 
 Some newer treatments have recently had some press coverage. None of those listed below is currently routine treatment for depression. However, further research may clarify how useful they are for depression:
 
 Eating a Mediterranean diet may help to prevent depression. One theory as to why this may help is that a diet high in olive oil may increase the amount of brain chemical called serotonin. This is similar to the effect of some antidepressants.
 
 Omega-3 supplements. A large review was unable to come to any definite conclusions and suggested that more research was required.
 
 Ketamine. A large review was unable to obtain enough evidence to arrive at any definite conclusions as to whether this medicine was helpful in depression.
 
 Some dos and don'ts
 
 Don't bottle things up and 'go it alone'. Try to tell people who are close to you how you feel. It is not weak to cry or admit that you are struggling.
 
 Don't despair - most people with depression recover. It is important to remember this.
 
 Do try to distract yourself by doing other things. Try doing things that do not need much concentration but can be distracting, such as watching TV. Radio or TV is useful late at night if sleeping is a problem.
 
 Do eat regularly, even if you do not feel like eating. Try to eat a healthy diet.
 
 Don't drink too much alcohol. Drinking alcohol is tempting to some people with depression, as the immediate effect may seem to relieve the symptoms. However, drinking heavily is likely to make your situation worse in the long run. Also, it is very difficult either to assess or to treat depression if you are drinking a lot of alcohol.
 
 Don't make any major decisions whilst you are depressed. It may be tempting to give up a job or move away to solve the problem. If at all possible you should delay any major decisions about relationships, jobs, or money until you are well again.
 
 Do tell your doctor if you feel that you are getting worse, particularly if suicidal thoughts are troubling you. See the separate leaflet called Dealing with Suicidal Thoughts.
 
 Sometimes a spell off work is needed. However, too long off work might not be so good, as dwelling on problems and brooding at home may make things worse. Getting back into the hurly-burly of normal life may help the healing process when things are improving. Each person is different and the ability to work will vary.
 
 Sometimes a specific psychological problem can cause depression but some people are reluctant to mention it. One example is sexual abuse as a child, leading to depression or psychological difficulties as an adult. Tell your doctor if you feel something like this is the root cause of your depression. Counselling may be available for such problems.
 
 Understanding that your symptoms are due to depression, may help you to accept that you are ill and need help. Some people ask: ""Am I going mad?"" It may be a relief to know that you are not going mad and that the symptoms you have are common and have been shared by many other people.
 
 You may 'bottle up' your symptoms from friends and relatives. However, if you are open about your feelings with close family and friends, it may help them to understand and help.
 
 Will it happen again?
 
 A one-off episode of depression at some stage in life is common. However, some people have two, three, or more episodes of depression. You can have treatment for each episode. But, if you are prone to repeated episodes of depression, options that may be considered by you and your doctor include the following:
 
 To take an antidepressant long-term to help prevent depression from returning.
 
 Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. This may be advised (if available) for people who are currently well but have had three or more episodes of depression. This therapy is a specialist type of talking treatment. There is good evidence that it can help to prevent depression returning. The therapy is typically done in groups of 8 to 15 people. It consists of weekly two-hour meetings over about eight weeks. There are then four follow-up sessions in the 12 months after the end of treatment.
 
 Some related conditions
 
 Postnatal depression
 
 Some women develop depression just after having a baby. See the separate leaflet called Postnatal Depression. 
 
 Bipolar disorder
 
 In some people, depression can alternate with periods of elation and overactivity (mania or hypomania). This is called bipolar disorder (sometimes called manic depression). Treatment tends to include mood stabilising medicines such as lithium. See the separate leaflet called Bipolar Disorder.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder
 
 Some people develop recurrent depression in the winter months only. This is called seasonal affective disorder (SAD). See the separate leaflet called Seasonal Affective Disorder.
 
 Other mental health problems
 
 Depression sometimes occurs at the same time as other mental health problems:
 
 People with anxiety, panic disorder and personality disorders quite commonly also develop depression. As a rule, depression should be treated first, followed by treatment of the other disorder. In particular, anxiety will often improve following treatment of depression.
 
 Eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia may accompany depression. In this situation the eating disorder is usually the main target of treatment.
 
 How to use the Yellow Card Scheme
 
 If you think you have had a side-effect to one of your medicines you can report this on the Yellow Card Scheme. You can do this online at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard.
 
 The Yellow Card Scheme is used to make pharmacists, doctors and nurses aware of any new side-effects that medicines or any other healthcare products may have caused. If you wish to report a side-effect, you will need to provide basic information about:
 
 The side-effect.
 
 The name of the medicine which you think caused it.
 
 The person who had the side-effect.
 
 Your contact details as the reporter of the side-effect.
 
 It is helpful if you have your medication - and/or the leaflet that came with it - with you while you fill out the report.",,

 Remember that nothing is inevitable
 
 If you've previously experienced low mood at this time of year, it's natural to worry that you might feel the same way again. However, whilst it's important to be mindful of the past, having experienced depression or low-mood at this time of year previously doesn't necessarily mean that winter will continue to bring on the same symptoms.
 
 ""When we are attuned to a certain way of thinking our body and our mind start to predict it,"" explains psychologist Alex Carling. ""But it's possible to retrain the internal system - nothing is inevitable.""

 Acknowledge that your feelings are normal
 
 As humans, we have more natural energy when exposed to higher levels of daylight; and it is widely believed that the shorter days of autumn and winter can change the level of chemicals in the body. It is this chemical change that can lead to SAD symptoms in some people.
 
 ""Whilst the exact cause of seasonal depression is not known, doctors believe that the lower levels of sunlight during the winter months can cause some people to produce less serotonin and more melatonin. Lack of serotonin in the brain can cause or exacerbate the symptoms of depression. And excess melatonin - a chemical that we produce during darker hours to encourage sleep - can cause lethargy,"" explains GP Dr Shamsul Kelman of Push Doctor.
 
 Even for those of us who don’t develop depression at this time of year, it's natural to feel a little more sluggish and lethargic as the daylight wanes. Although not a cure in itself, remembering that this is a natural process can both reassure and make us feel a little better.
 
 ""For most people it is natural and normal that you would have less energy with less daylight; it's a good idea to accept this as a natural process rather than fight it,"" explains Sally Heady, cognitive hypnotherapist.
 
 Be realistic
 
 These days, it can sometimes feel as if everyone else is constantly having the time of their lives. With friends posting happy photos on Facebook, and influencers on Instagram sharing glamorous snaps, it can seem as if we're the only ones who don't feel on top of the world. So it's important to remember that, whilst it's great to be positive, nobody feels happy all of the time.
 
 ""When we watch TV or go on social media, we are given the impression that we ought to feel confident and happy at all times. But I don't think this is helpful. Feeling nervous or unsure sometimes is a normal part of our brain's survival system. We shouldn't beat ourselves up if we don't feel 100% confident,"" explains Heady.

 Give yourself some TLC
 
 As adults, we're constantly rushing from task to task, often forgetting to look after ourselves properly. But it's important to take a little 'me time' - however short - to help us to feel more positive. If you're someone who feels a bit blue at this time of year then it's even more important to make the effort.
 
 ""We often put ourselves too far down our priority list; taking time for yourself and putting yourself first can really boost your mood,"" says Heady. ""Taking some time for yourself to do something you enjoy can work wonders.""
 
 Keep up the momentum
 
 If you've started a new fitness regime, or taken up a new sport over the summer, a bit of bad weather or a few dark evenings shouldn't stop you keeping up the good work. Exercise is great for boosting both our mood and energy, so it's all the more important to keep it up at this time of year.
 
 ""It's natural for our energy to slump when the days get shorter,"" explains online fitness trainer Julia Buckley. ""But if you’ve got into a good routine which included outdoor exercise and can't face the cold or rain, simply take it indoors. There are lots of workout ideas online, or you could join a local class. Exercise is a great mood booster and the perfect antidote for the winter blues as it warms our bodies and puts us in a better state of mind - not to mention the health benefits!""
 
 Eat well
 
 The change in seasons often signals a change in diet - salads may be ditched for warmer, heartier meals. But to keep yourself strong, it's important to eat right during the winter.
 
 ""At this time of year, it's easy to get low on the sunshine nutrient vitamin D,"" explains dietician Bahee Van de Bor. ""Lack of B vitamins, folate, iron and selenium in your diet can also affect your mood, but eating the right foods can help.""
 
 ""Try to eat beans and pulses throughout the week, paired with whole grains such as basmati rice, oats, wholemeal bread and pasta. To keep on top of vitamin D, don't forget to take your daily vitamin D supplement over winter. A weekly portion of oily fish will boost your omega 3s naturally, which is another mood-enhancing food.""
 
 Write in your diary
 
 If you do find yourself feeling low, it may be a good idea to start a reflective diary. This can help you to recognise the impermanence of your feelings and highlight moments of joy.
 
 ""Using a reflection diary, either yourself or with your child, can help you to recognise all the positives you've had in your day. Perhaps when you do something kind, or someone else does,"" explains Carling.
 
 ""Those positive emotions can counterbalance stress or feelings of depression. It helps to retrain the internal system so that we can almost park certain feelings and make a conscious effort to focus on something else.""
 
 Get a diagnosis
 
 Feeling a little blue is normal, but if you start to experience depressive symptoms or feel constantly unhappy, it's important to speak to your GP to see whether you need additional support.
 
 ""If you suspect you might be suffering from SAD, consult your GP,"" advises Heady. ""They will be able to advise you on lifestyle changes or appropriate treatment.""
 
 As well as talking therapies and medication, many sufferers of SAD find light-boxes to be extremely helpful.
 
 ""Talk to your GP about the benefits of light-boxes - which encourage the body to release chemicals it needs in order to feel more alert and energised,"" advises Heady.
 
 Enjoy your 'mini-hibernation'
 
 Rather than constantly fighting the natural energy slump entirely, taking a bit of a break over the winter months and embracing this time of year might help you to feel more positive.
 
 ""Summer is an active busy season; people are on holiday, juggling commitments, and tend to be more busy and active,"" says Heady.
 
 ""Winter can be a real opportunity to take stock and have your own mini-hibernation. Then when spring arrives, you feel that natural lift in energy, flowers are budding and it tends to be a more optimistic time of year. You can make the most of that renewed sense of energy.""",,

 What is broken heart syndrome?
 
 There really is a medical condition called broken heart syndrome. It's a form of cardiomyopathy - damage to the heart muscle which causes the muscle to weaken and balloon out. Its medical name is takotsubo cardiomyopathy, after a traditional Japanese fishing basket called a takotsubo. That's because the condition makes the heart swell to the same shape as the fishing basket. Doctors aren't quite sure why it happens, but it usually comes on after severe trauma or emotional stress, such as bereavement.
 
 Broken heart syndrome affects women more often than men, and is more common in those aged over 50. The first symptom is often severe chest pain, so many people think they are having a heart attack. As the heart muscle weakens, it stops being able to pump blood around the body efficiently. This in turn leads to a build-up of fluid in the lungs, with shortness of breath especially on lying flat, and swelling of the ankles - otherwise known as heart failure. Palpitations - either abnormally fast or slow beats - are also common.
 
 The tests for broken heart syndrome include heart tracings and blood tests to exclude heart attack, along with X-rays and heart scans which often show up the abnormal heart shape. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms. For instance, heart rate-controlling tablets to stabilise heart rhythm and blood pressure (which can drop); water tablets to reduce fluid build-up; and blood-thinning agents if blood clots or an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF) occur.
 
 Fortunately, the vast majority of people recover completely within weeks. However, once you've had broken heart syndrome once, you're at higher risk of getting symptoms again if you go through another major stress.",,

 The testimony above comes from a man in London who suffers from summer seasonal depression.
 
 For most people, the warmer months are a time of health and optimism, a chance to reconnect with the great outdoors after the dark, seemingly interminable, months of winter.
 
 However, for a minority of those with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), it can be a miserable time. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, around 10% of people with SAD in the USA experience it in reverse, ie during the warm months of summer.
 
 Longer days, increased heat and humidity as well as issues around body image may be contributing factors, while symptoms are thought to include loss of appetite, disrupted sleep, weight loss and anxiety.

 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) explained
 
 Most of us are affected by the change in seasons - it's not unusual to feel more cheerful and energetic when the sun is shining and the days are longer, or to find that you eat more or sleep longer in winter. But if you experience SAD, seasonal changes have a much bigger effect on mood and energy levels, and may lead to symptoms of depression that significantly impact day-to-day life.
 
 ""Most people experience SAD during the winter,"" explains Stephen Buckley, head of information at the mental health charity Mind. ""Less commonly, some people find they experience SAD in reverse, with depressive symptoms occurring in summer. SAD is most common in countries like the UK where there are large changes in the weather and daylight hours during the different seasons.""

 Summertime SADness
 
 The causes of SAD, and especially summer SAD, aren't always clear, reveals Buckley.
 
 ""It is important to say that the causes of SAD are unlikely to be purely physical and that we don't fully understand them,"" he stresses. ""It's likely that other elements such as difficult life events, trauma and physical illness can also cause depression and SAD, and the impact SAD has on you will also be affected by your overall feelings and coping skills.""
 
 Summer can bring specific challenges that might affect people’s mental health, Buckley reveals.
 
 ""Lots of people find body image worries are heightened in summer, especially for people who are unhappy with their weight, size or have scars from self-harming, for example. Also, longer daylight hours and shorter nights can cause disruption to our sleep, and it might be harder to get the amount of sleep that some people need to keep well.""
 
 Look out for possible symptoms
 
 According to UK voluntary organisation SADA, sleep problems (disturbed nights as well as excessive tiredness during the day) are a common symptom of SAD. Others include depression, lethargy, loss of libido, anxiety and irritability, and a craving for carbohydrates and sweet foods.
 
 ""Many of us experience a dip in our mood or a touch of the 'winter blues',"" says Buckley. ""But if you experience SAD, you may find it difficult to stay in work and maintain relationships, and can lose all interest in the things in life you used to enjoy.""
 
 Be proactive this summer
 
 Thankfully, with a little planning there are myriad practical ways to take the fight to SAD this summer.
 
 Plan ahead so you feel in control, both socially and professionally, and don't worry if you feel out of step with everyone else. After all, you're not obliged to be happy just because it is summer.
 
 Be sure to exercise during cooler times of the day, and wind down with relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, deep breathing or muscle relaxation.
 
 Create a sleep action plan. Blackout curtains, lighter blankets, and practical gadgets such as fans and air conditioners can help you recharge your batteries during the night.
 
 Step into the light
 
 In addition to self-help, a salad of treatments can help alleviate the symptoms of SAD during the summer months.
 
 ""Light therapy may be helpful for some people, and can work within three to five days,"" confirms Buckley. ""It involves daily exposure to a very bright specialist light, usually for a couple of hours a day.""
 
 Talking treatments, such as counselling, psychotherapy or cognitive behavioural therapy, can be extremely useful in helping people to cope with symptoms. Antidepressants may also be prescribed for people with severe SAD, and can be combined with light therapy for maximum effect.
 
 ""If you're worried about your mental health, it's always a good idea to seek help - even if you're not sure if you are experiencing a specific mental health problem such as SAD or depression,"" Buckley concludes.",,

 Negative thought loops
 
 Examples
 
 Next steps
 
 We all struggle with negative thoughts from time to time. To let go of them and replace them, awareness is key.
 
 PeopleImages/Getty Images
 
 Have you ever noticed that when you’re in a low mood, negative thoughts come darting into your mind, one after the other? Before long, it can turn your day from bad to worse.
 
 This is part one of a three-part series about how to deal with negative thoughts. Part one (this article) talks about how to become aware of them. Part two is about how to let them go. Part three discusses how to replace negative thoughts with positive ones.
 
 This series is written from the perspective of a yoga instructor in recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and years of anxious, depressive thoughts.
 
 When it comes to change, awareness is the first step. Trying to stop negative thoughts through willpower alone is like fumbling around in a dark room trying to find a key — it’s a whole lot easier once you turn on the light.
 
 1. Slow down
 
 To become aware of your negative thoughts, create quiet time in your day and whitespace in your schedule.
 
 When life is go-go-go, it may be difficult to hear the extent of your inner critic. You might just get bits and pieces without ever realizing how much it’s affecting you.
 
 You could find it helpful to make time for your inner world by putting away your phone. For example, instead of driving while listening to a podcast, or watching YouTube while you eat a meal, power down your technology and listen to your thought loops instead.
 
 Not exactly fun. But when you create silence, you can finally hear your inner voice speak.
 
 2. Keep a thought log
 
 Imagine you’re a scientist. The best way to get to know your subject (you) is with a bit of data collection.
 
 You can start by carrying around a little notebook in your pocket, or creating a fresh list on your phone.
 
 Get curious. Every time you hear a negative thought cross your mind, write it down and make a note of what triggered it. Once in a while, look them over and notice what stands out to you.

 3. Meditate
 
 Of the 150 mental health experts polled for this article series, more than 90% of them mentioned meditation as an important tool — if not the most important tool.
 
 If you can, try to meditate for 5 to 20 minutes each morning. If you don’t feel like creating a whole ritual, it can be as simple as sitting up in bed.
 
 You don’t even have to worry about “doing” anything as you sit there, like quieting your thoughts. Simply watch the show in your mind.
 
 Meditation creates a neutral zone for observation. It provides behind-the-scenes access to your thoughts so you can watch them without having to identify with them. It creates a sense of choice: You can believe your thoughts, or watch them go by.
 
 powered by Rubicon Project
 
 4. Journal
 
 A journaling practice at the same time every day can help take the edge off. Your negative thoughts, once down on paper, may appear much less threatening.
 
 Later, reread what you wrote and see if you can identify thought patterns.
 
 From there, you can examine what core wounds may be causing the negative thoughts in the first place. For example, if you have a negative thought that says, “I’m an imposter at work,” perhaps the underlying belief is, “I’m not good enough.”
 
 When you identify the underlying belief, you can do some healing work around it and unravel the narrative that you’re operating from. It’s like switching from autopilot to manual mode — you’re now in charge again.
 
 Why do I keep having negative thoughts?
 
 Believe it or not, negative thoughts are your brain’s way of trying to protect you.
 
 Your mind is like an advanced software program, constantly picking up new information and sorting pieces of intel into “good” and “bad” piles, so that it knows whether to repeat, delete, or shelve for later.
 
 The problem is, the more your brain does this, the better it gets at it. Negative thinking becomes an efficient super-highway in the prefrontal cortex, bypassing perspective and rational thought.
 
 For example, if you post a photo on Instagram and it gets 99 good comments, and 1 bad comment, for the rest of the day your mind might hone in on that one outlier. Focusing on this is called a negativity biasTrusted Source.
 
 On top of that, our built-in mechanism to counterbalance these negative thoughts — the frontal lobe — can be easily overridden by fear, sadness, or trauma.
 
 Research suggests that certain mental health conditions are related to rumination, excess worry, or negative self-perception, which can all contribute to negative thinking.
 
 Some of these include:
 
 anxiety disorders
 
 avoidant personality disorder (APD)
 
 bipolar disorder
 
 borderline personality disorder (BPD)
 
 depression
 
 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
 
 PTSD
 
 rejection sensitive dysphoria, a feature of ADHD
 
 Thanks to something called “neuroplasticity” — the plastic nature of your brain — you may be able to reroute the thoughts in your brain with some attention, intention, and training.
 
 What are some examples of negative thoughts?
 
 If a thought makes you feel lousy or stops you from going after something, it’s likely a negative one. Here are four clues: put-downs, always/never, magnification, and should’s.
 
 Putting yourself down
 
 This is internalizing a mistake and interpreting it as a character defect. In other words, you think that you’re “bad” instead of thinking that your behavior is “bad.”
 
 Examples include:
 
 I’m not good enough for that job.
 
 I’m unworthy of that promotion.
 
 I don’t deserve them.
 
 I’m a broken person.
 
 Always/never thinking
 
 This is a type of cognitive distortion. Black-and-white or all-or-nothing thinking creates an unbalanced perspective of how you show up in the world:
 
 It’s always my fault.
 
 I’ll never be good enough.
 
 I fail at everything.
 
 Nobody loves me.
 
 There’s nothing I’m good at.
 
 Magnifying small criticisms
 
 This is being overly critical with yourself for something relatively small or benign:
 
 I look ridiculous.
 
 I’m such a loser.
 
 I’m a total mess at work.
 
 I was the worst presenter there.
 
 Thoughts that start with ‘I should’ or ‘I shouldn’t’
 
 This is judging yourself poorly against your own expectations or those that have been imposed on you, perhaps by a caregiver in early childhood:
 
 I should have gotten into that school.
 
 I shouldn’t have asked for that salary.
 
 I should be in better shape by now.
 
 I shouldn’t have eaten that cake.",,

 What’s next?
 
 We all feel sad sometimes. But if you’ve been feeling very low for more than two weeks, you may be experiencing depression.
 
 Sadness, anger, and tiredness are all natural human emotions. We’re usually able to manage these feelings, and they don’t tend to get in the way of our lives too much.
 
 Depression, on the other hand, is a serious condition that affects your mental and physical health. It affects your mood, how you see yourself, and even your eating and sleeping habits.
 
 Depression is a mental health condition that lasts two weeks or more in which you feel sad, emotionally sensitive, hopeless, or uninterested in things that you usually love.
 
 The good news is that depression is treatable, and help is available. Lots of treatments can help, including therapy, self-care, and in some cases, antidepressants.
 
 What is depression?
 
 Depression is a widespread mental health disorder. So if you have it, you’re definitely not alone.
 
 In fact, depression is one of the leading causes of disability in the United States and worldwide. It affects around 264 million peopleTrusted Source globally and 17.3 million adults in the United States.
 
 Other names for depression include major depressive disorder, major depression, and clinical depression.
 
 We all feel sad or lonely from time to time. That’s part of being human.
 
 But if you feel low or hopeless often — like almost daily — it might be depression. This is especially true if you’ve been experiencing symptoms for 2 weeks or longer.
 
 You might not know what’s causing these lingering symptoms. You might not even know when they began. All you know is that you just haven’t felt like yourself in a while.
 
 “Depression is something that doesn’t have much to do with outside circumstances,” says Rachelle Heinemann, a licensed mental health counselor in Brooklyn, New York. “There doesn’t seem to be a reason for it.”
 
 In other cases, depression has an identifiable cause. A stressful life event, such as a sudden loss or a relationship change, might trigger low moods.
 
 If these moods last a long time or are relatively severe, this might be considered depression, especially in someone who has a history of depressive episodes.
 
 The loss of a loved one, or even the ending of a relationship, can lead to deep feelings of sadness or grief, but those feelings aren’t the same as having depression.
 
 The grieving process tends to go in waves: Some moments, you might have positive memories or feel OK. Other times, you’ll feel down or lose interest in things you once loved. You also don’t usually suffer from low self-esteem or self-loathing during grief — but those are common symptoms of depression.
 
 However, grief can lead to complicated grief or depression, especially if you find it difficult to move on from the loss.
 
 Want to learn more? You can read about the stages of grief and mourning here.
 
 Are there different kinds of depression?
 
 Yes. Depression isn’t a one-size-fits-all.
 
 “Many people with depression don’t even know they have it,” says Adrienne Meier, a clinical psychologist and telehealth practitioner. “Symptoms are often misattributed to fatigue or stress or even just ‘getting older.'”
 
 These are different kinds of depression:
 
 Persistent depressive disorder (Dysthymia): This condition is not as intense, but it drags on for two years or longer.
 
 Depressive psychosis: This is a combination of severe depression and delusions or hallucinations.
 
 Bipolar disorder: You alternate between periods of high energy and risky behavior (mania) and severe depression in which you find it difficult to cope.
 
 Atypical depression: You might feel better for short periods in response to positive events. It can start earlier in life and last a long time.
 
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): This condition causes severe irritability, depression, or anxiety during the time between ovulation and your period.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder: Most common in winter or regions where the days are particularly short in fall and winter. It’s believed to be caused by changes in circadian rhythms, serotonin, and melatonin in response to reduced light exposure.
 
 Situational depression (or adjustment disorder): Begins with a stressful life event, such as a death, move, or family change. It usually begins within 3 months of the event and tends to resolve within 6 months.
 
 Postpartum depression: Occurs during pregnancy or within 12 months of giving birth. It usually coincides with the hormonal and physical changes that come with parenthood.
 
 Major depression: Also known as clinical depression, this is the most common kind of depression (and the focus of this article).

 What are the symptoms of major depression?
 
 Major depression can cause a range of symptoms that last 2 weeks or longer.
 
 Depression appears differently for each person, and its symptoms are not always consistent or clear-cut. You don’t need to experience all of the following to receive a diagnosis of depression, but it usually involves a combination of these symptoms:
 
 Persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness
 
 “[Depression] feels deeper than sadness,” Heinemann says.
 
 You might find yourself wondering what’s the point of getting up, or you might cry more easily.
 
 Some people with depression say that it feels as if they’ve sunk into a deep, dark hole with no way out, and they have little to no hope that things will ever change.
 
 Others feel worthless or guilty. You might find yourself dwelling on things you wish you could have done differently.
 
 Or, you might not like yourself much right now. Self-loathing is a frequent symptom.
 
 You’re less interested in things you usually enjoy
 
 “Someone struggling [with depression] might lose interest in doing the things they used to be passionate about,” Heinemann says.
 
 For example, if you used to lovegoing for walks, playing sports, or painting, but now you dread the idea of doing any of those things, that’s a big red flag for depression.
 
 Depression can also impact your desire for sex, according to research.
 
 You find it hard to concentrate, get things done, or take care of yourself
 
 “Often those suffering from depression describe it as a weight on top of them, suffocating them, making it impossible to get out of bed or take care of their basic needs,” says Heinemann. “They feel drowned by depression.”
 
 This can feel like being really low on energy.
 
 “Some people find it difficult to do things like showering or brushing their teeth,” she says.
 
 Others struggle with simple chores or concentrating at work. Even making decisions can feel difficult if you have depression.
 
 “Depression tends to hijack our brain, so the strategies we usually use or rely on [to get things done] aren’t helpful because our brains are lying to us,” explains Meier. “We are seeing the world through poop-covered glasses.”
 
 You feel irritable
 
 Research suggests that irritability is a symptom that’s most common in males, but it can affect anyone. Irritability and aggression are also common signs of depression in children.
 
 So if you find yourself prone to anger, aggressiveness, or feel as if everyone around you is irritating, this could signal depression.
 
 Your sleep patterns have changed
 
 You might feel tired all the time and find yourself sleeping a lot more than usual. Or you might find it difficult to sleep even when you’re tired, so you spend long nights awake in bed.
 
 But research suggests that most peopleTrusted Source experience some sleep disturbance when they have depression.
 
 Your appetite has changed
 
 As with sleep, depression affects people’s appetites differently. Some people are hungry or feel the urge to eat all the time. Others don’t feel like eating at all.
 
 Changes in your appetite can affect your weight, too — and quickly. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) says that depression can lead to weight gain or loss of more than 5% of your body weight in a month.
 
 You feel anxious
 
 Depression doesn’t really cause anxiety, but a lot of people experience both conditions at the same time. So you might feel nervous, restless, or worried a lot. Your heart rate or breathing might change when you start to worry, or you might feel twitchy.
 
 Feeling anxious? Here are 9 ways that can help to relieve anxiety right away.
 
 Your body aches
 
 For some people, depression causes physical symptoms like aches, pains and lots of headaches or migrainesTrusted Source. Other people might be more sensitive to pain than usual.
 
 For example, one study found that some people with mental health disorders — including major depression — had migraine attacks that preceded them.
 
 You think about self-harm or suicide
 
 This is the most serious symptom of depression — even if your thoughts of death or suicide are fleeting and don’t involve plans to follow through.
 
 Some people have death ideation, which means feeling as if you don’t want to be alive anymore but don’t intend or have thoughts about self-harm or suicide.
 
 If you or someone you know is considering suicide, you’re not alone. Help is available right now:

 What causes it?
 
 Sometimes, people become depressed due to difficulties coping with many things over a period of time. Many find that work stress, relationship problems, and other issues accumulate over time.
 
 Life events or major life changes, like moving away, can also cause depression and related conditions.
 
 Feeling a lack of meaning or purpose can be one of the most common causes of depression, especially when you lose contact with activities that provide a sense of meaning, purpose, or sense of self.
 
 A number of things that can cause or contribute to depression, including:
 
 Brain structure: Research suggests that the hippocampus is smaller in some people with depression. A less active frontal lobe could also cause it.
 
 Biochemistry: Differences in certain brain chemicals could contribute to depression.
 
 Family history: You are more likely to have depression if depression or another mental health condition runs in your family.
 
 Trauma: Stressful or traumatic events can impact how your body reacts to fear and stress in the future, which raises your risk of depression. This is especially trueTrusted Source for childhood trauma.
 
 Medical conditions: Chronic illness or pain, insomnia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are some of the conditions that could put you at a higher risk of developing depression.
 
 Environmental factors: Exposure to abuse, violence, poverty, or trauma could make you more vulnerable to depression.
 
 How is depression diagnosed?
 
 If you are noticing the symptoms of depression, a healthcare professional can help get you a diagnosis.
 
 This will likely begin with a conversation and a physical examination. Your doctor will likely ask you about your family history to see if depression or other mental health conditions run in your family.
 
 If you’re talking with your primary physician, they might also order blood tests to ensure that another medical condition isn’t the cause of your symptoms. For example, the fatigue or lethargy you can feel with depression could also be caused by vitamin deficienciesTrusted Source or a thyroid issue.
 
 If your doctor can’t find another cause for your symptoms, they will likely refer you to a licensed mental health expert who will evaluate your mood, behavior, and day-to-day activities.
 
 They will also ask you about your family’s psychological history. They may use a depression-rating questionnaire, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), to diagnose the condition.
 
 According to the DSM-5, you have to display at least five of the main symptoms of depression for over two weeks to get a diagnosis.
 
 When to talk with a doctor
 
 If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, it’s always best to talk with a healthcare professional, especially since some symptoms can be caused by underlying medical conditions rather than depression. The sooner you talk with them, the sooner you can get the help you need to start feeling better.
 
 It’s OK if you’re feeling reluctant to talk to a mental health expert or doctor, but you have nothing to be ashamed of. It’s OK to ask for help. If you’re not comfortable sharing, then no one except you and your doctor has to know that you’re seeking treatment.
 
 “We go to a doctor when our body isn’t feeling well, and we go to a therapist when our emotions feel out of whack,” says Heinemann. “Depression is not your fault, nor is it something you can just snap out of.”
 
 What’s next?
 
 Once you receive a diagnosis of depression, your mental health professional will discuss possible treatments for depression with you, including one or a combination of the following:
 
 Antidepressants: These can help you begin to see improvement in your symptoms within a few weeks, though it could be a couple of months before you truly begin to feel better.
 
 Psychotherapy: Better known as talk therapy, psychotherapy can help you learn to problem-solve and recognize negative thinking. Your therapist can also help you maximize meaningful behaviors and activities during your week. This helps many people cope with challenges in a more adaptive way.
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): This is reserved for people with the most severe kinds of depression who haven’t responded to other treatments. This is a safe and effective treatment.
 
 Feeling better will be a process: It won’t happen overnight. But with time, you’ll notice an improvement in the way that you feel.

 Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions, affecting more than 264 million people worldwide.
 
 Westend61/Getty Images
 
 A sense of hopelessness, the feeling of being “weighed down,” and a loss of enjoyment in things that used to bring you joy — these are some common signs of depression, one of the most widespread mental health issues in the world.
 
 Clinical depression goes by many names, such as “the blues,” biological or clinical depression, and major depressive disorder (MDD). The World Health Organization (WHO)Trusted Source estimates that over 264 million people live with depression.
 
 Even simple things — like getting dressed in the morning or eating at mealtime — can feel like large obstacles when you have depression.
 
 Depression symptoms take many forms, and no two people’s experiences are exactly alike. A person with depression may not always seem sad to others. And when friends or family do notice signs of depression, they may want to help but not know how.
 
 What is depression?
 
 The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimates that about 7% of U.S. adults experience depression each year.
 
 Clinical depression is different from sadness or grief — like when you lose a loved one, experience a relationship breakup, or get laid off from work — as it usually consumes you in your day-to-day living.
 
 Unlike sadness, depression doesn’t stop after only a day or two. It can continue for weeks on end, interfering with your work or school, relationships with others, and ability to enjoy life.
 
 Some people feel as if a huge hole of emptiness has opened inside when experiencing the hopelessness associated with depression. Apathy and anhedonia, or inability to feel pleasure, are common aspects of depression.
 
 Depression symptoms and diagnosis
 
 You’ll likely speak with a mental health professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or clinical social worker, who could diagnose your condition.
 
 Though a general practitioner or family doctor can make an initial diagnosis, a specialist can provide complete follow-up and treatment.
 
 If you’ve experienced most of the following symptoms every day over 2 or more weeks, you might meet the criteria for a depression diagnosis:
 
 a persistent feeling of loneliness or sadness
 
 lack of energy
 
 feelings of hopelessness
 
 getting too much or too little sleep
 
 eating too much or too little
 
 difficulties with concentration or attention
 
 loss of interest in enjoyable activities or socializing
 
 feelings of guilt and worthlessness
 
 thoughts of death or suicide
 
 Depression can look very different from person to person, and the intensity of the symptoms may also vary. Also, if you have depression, you might not experience every symptom.
 
 Depression can appear differently in children than in adults. Some symptoms in children can include anxiety or anxious behavior.
 
 Learn more about symptoms of depression.
 
 Types of depression
 
 While MDD is the main diagnosis associated with depression, there are also other kinds of depression. Each form of depression has its own set of symptoms.
 
 Major depressive disorder (MDD)
 
 MDD is what comes to mind for most people when they think of depression. It’s also the most common depression diagnosis.
 
 If you experience a loss of pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, along with a depressed mood that lasts at least 2 weeks, you might meet the criteria for MDD. In children and teens, MDD can also look like irritability rather than sadness.
 
 Postpartum depression
 
 Postpartum depression is depression that can occur in people who have just given birth. It can also occur in other parents and caregivers who haven’t given birth.
 
 Typically, postpartum depression can begin in the first month after giving birth, but it can also begin during pregnancy. If you have a history of depression, you may be more likely to experience postpartum depression.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder
 
 Seasonal affective disorder is a subtype of depression triggered by seasonal changes. Though it’s more common in the winter and fall months, it can occur in the summer as well.
 
 If you notice persistent sadness or lack of energy during a certain time of year, you might have seasonal depression. Treatment includes light therapy, establishing consistent sleep routines, and talk therapy.
 
 Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)
 
 Persistent depressive disorder (PDD), previously known as dysthymia and chronic major depression, is a form of depression that lasts for at least 2 years.
 
 While it can be more challenging to treat than other types of depression, it’s possible to get relief from symptoms. If you’re diagnosed with PDD, you’ll likely work with your healthcare professional to create a treatment strategy that’s best suited for you.
 
 Bipolar disorder depression
 
 Some forms of bipolar disorder involve depressive episodes. Sometimes depressive episodes alternate with episodes of mania or hypomania.
 
 Treatment for bipolar disorder depression can differ from other depression treatment approaches. For example, due to the nature of bipolar disorder, antidepressants are not always a safe way to manage bipolar disorder symptoms.
 
 Other depression subtypes
 
 Other subtypes of depression include depression with the following:
 
 anxious
 
 melancholic
 
 psychotic
 
 catatonic
 
 atypical
 
 If you talk with a therapist, you might learn if any of these specifiers apply to you. You can also learn more about the types of depression below.
 
 Learn more about depression types.
 
 Depression risk factors and causes
 
 As with most mental health conditions, researchers still aren’t sure what causes depression. But most experts consider the following to be contributing factors:
 
 genetics
 
 gut bacteria
 
 family history
 
 personality
 
 environment
 
 social factors and upbringing
 
 Anyone can experience depression. But some risk factors indicate how likely you are to experience it.
 
 For instance, women might be 2 to 3 timesTrusted Source as likely as men to develop depression.
 
 According to the NIMH, other risk factors for depression can include:
 
 a family history of mood disorders
 
 major life changes
 
 trauma or chronic stress
 
 medical conditions
 
 certain medications
 
 alcohol or other substance use
 
 Even if you don’t identify with any depression risk factors, you could still meet the criteria for a depression diagnosis. You can learn more about the causes and risk factors for depression below.
 
 Learn more about risk factors and causes of depression.
 
 Depression treatment
 
 Can depression actually be successfully treated? The short answer is yes.
 
 According to the NIMH and countless research studies over the past 6 decades, clinical depression is readily treated with short-term, goal-oriented psychotherapy or talk therapy and antidepressant medications.
 
 For most people, a combination of the two works best and is often recommended by healthcare professionals.
 
 Psychotherapy
 
 Psychotherapy approaches scientifically proven to work with depression include:
 
 cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
 
 interpersonal therapy
 
 psychodynamic therapy
 
 Therapy is one of the most effective treatments for all types of depression, and it has very few side effects. It’s also typically covered by all insurers.
 
 Self-help strategies
 
 For mild depression, many people begin with self-help strategies and emotional support. ResearchTrusted Source also indicates some herbal remedies, including St. John’s wort and saffron, may help relieve certain depression symptoms.
 
 Exercise and diet are other factors to consider when building a routine to manage depression. Though it can be difficult to practice consistent self-care habits when experiencing a depressive episode, small steps can help.
 
 Medication
 
 Antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed medications for depression.
 
 When psychotherapy and antidepressants don’t work, clinicians may consider other treatment options. Usually, additional medication to support the existing antidepressant medication is considered.
 
 Additional treatment options such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be tried in more serious cases.
 
 Effective treatment depends on recognizing there’s a problem, seeking to address it, and following a treatment plan. This can be challenging when you have depression, but patience is key when beginning treatment.
 
 No matter how hopeless things may feel, you can get better with treatment — many people do.
 
 You can learn more about the benefits of psychotherapy and medications and whether you should consider one or both in our in-depth depression treatment guide below.
 
 Learn more about your depression treatment options.
 
 Living with depression
 
 If you live with depression, simply waking up in the morning and getting out of bed can feel like a struggle.
 
 Everyday tasks — like showering, eating, or going to work or school — can sometimes feel like large hurdles to a person living with depression.
 
 One key to managing living with depression is ensuring you’re receiving treatment or taking steps to build a solid self-care routine. Treatment could include therapy, medication, or both.
 
 Also, being an active participant in your own wellness plan can be helpful. While this can require effort, it can be done. For some people with depression, leaning on a support network or trusted loved one can help.
 
 Establishing self-care routines is important in managing depression. Getting regular emotional support — for instance, through an online support group — can also be beneficial.

 Helping someone with depression
 
 When you see a family member or friend experiencing an episode of depression, it’s normal to want to reach out and lend a hand. But when it comes to depression, what you can do to help isn’t always clear.
 
 Loved ones of a person with depression may remain silent, fearful of making the situation worse or alienating the person they care about. And while more people are becoming aware of depression and its effects, stigma tied to the condition persists and prevents people from discussing it.
 
 If you think a loved one could be experiencing a depressive episode, there are ways you can offer support.
 
 Below are some articles that offer guidance for people who want to learn how they can best support a loved one who has depression.

 Living with depression
 
 Recap
 
 Treatment-resistant depression is when you’re taking medication for depression symptoms, but it isn’t working as well as you need it to. If you’re living with this condition, there are a few alternative treatments to consider.
 
 Depression that doesn’t respond well to antidepressants is known as treatment-resistant depression.
 
 About halfTrusted Source of people experiencing depression symptoms may see a slight or no improvement when they take antidepressants. This leaves lingering symptoms that can strain your mental, emotional, and physical well-being.
 
 However, there are steps you can take to effectively manage symptoms of depression.
 
 What is treatment-resistant depression?
 
 Experts say depression is treatment-resistant when your symptoms haven’t improved after you’ve tried two antidepressants. You must have taken them at the optimal dose for an appropriate amount of time to see an effect, usually about 4 to 6 weeks.
 
 If a healthcare professional has prescribed you two or more antidepressants and your depression symptoms persist, speak with a psychiatrist.
 
 If you started your medication regimen with a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse practitioner, ask them about the possibility of trying different solutions.
 
 What to expect with a psychiatrist
 
 A psychiatrist may begin asking questions to learn more about you. They may be particularly interested in finding out if you:
 
 also have an anxiety or personality disorder
 
 smoke or use recreational drugs
 
 have other chronic, nonpsychiatric conditions, such as autoimmune diseases
 
 These conditions and behaviors are common among people experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Addressing them may improve your response to treatment.
 
 To get a more complete picture of your health, the psychiatrist may also order blood work, such as:
 
 a complete blood count
 
 liver and kidney function tests
 
 lipid and glucose tests
 
 a thyroid test
 
 They may also ask questions to assess the symptoms and their severity to track how these change over time.
 
 These questions can also help determine whether the treatment resistance you’re experiencing is due to an undiagnosed, underlying condition.
 
 For example, bipolar disorder is common among people experiencing treatment-resistant depression.
 
 Medication strategies
 
 You still have several options when it comes to medication for treatment-resistant depression.
 
 Antidepressants
 
 Even if you’ve experienced resistance to antidepressants so far, they might still work for you.
 
 Your healthcare professional may try optimizing your current treatment by giving it more time to work or increasing the dose.
 
 Different classes of antidepressants work in different ways, so your psychiatrist may also consider switching you to a different class of antidepressant.
 
 Some common classes of antidepressant include:
 
 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
 
 dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
 
 tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
 
 monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
 
 Doctors and psychiatrists generally start people experiencing symptoms first on an SSRI, so if you’re experiencing treatment-resistant depression, you may have already tried an antidepressant from this category.
 
 People who don’t respond to an SSRI may experience improved symptoms once they switch to a TCA, MAOI, or certain SNRIs, according to researchTrusted Source.
 
 Adjuvant treatments
 
 Your doctor may also try adding another medication alongside your antidepressant to boost effectiveness. Healthcare professionals call this augmentation or adjuvant treatment.
 
 Some common adjuvants include:
 
 lithium
 
 thyroid hormone (T3)
 
 a second-generation antipsychotic, such as quetiapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, or risperidone
 
 benzodiazepines or hydroxyzine, for people with anxiety
 
 a hypnotic, such as zolpidem or zopiclone, if you have trouble sleeping
 
 Your psychiatrist may also consider combining treatments to help treat your condition from multiple angles.
 
 Ketamine
 
 In recent years, the drug ketamine has emerged as a potential option for treatment-resistant depression.
 
 Healthcare professionals originally used it as an anesthetic. However, new researchTrusted Source has found that ketamine acts as a pain reliever and sedative at lower doses and exerts multiple effects on the parts of the brain associated with depression.
 
 One systematic reviewTrusted Source of studies showed that it is generally safe for adults and that you may experience relief from depression symptoms as soon as 4 hours after using it.
 
 However, researchers know less about its effects in older people, children, and teenagers. More research is needed.
 
 Research has shown that ketamine infusions are effective, but the drug is also available as a nasal spray.
 
 Because the use of ketamine to treat depression symptoms is so new, there isn’t a standard protocol for how or when you should use it.
 
 Generally, though, ketamine is reserved for people experiencing severe symptoms of treatment-resistant depression who need immediate relief, such as those at risk of suicide.
 
 Therapy
 
 Getting psychological counseling can help address the many ways depression symptoms affect your life, including your emotional, social, and physical health.
 
 People may call this psychotherapy, counseling, or talk therapy.
 
 The goal of counseling is to discover the core issues underlying your symptoms and equip you with the tools to improve your sense of well-being and relieve feelings of distress.
 
 Counseling can help you with decision-making skills, maintaining healthy relationships, stress management and coping techniques, and developing a healthy self-esteem.
 
 Experts say the goals of psychotherapy or counseling are to:
 
 equip you with the tools to recognize when your symptoms are getting worse
 
 help you develop coping strategies for stressful situations
 
 provide psychological support for the symptoms of depression
 
 provide education about your condition
 
 help you stick with treatment recommendations
 
 manage other psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety or substance use disorder
 
 The top two points in this list may be the most effective for helping you relieve symptoms.
 
 What to try if therapy isn’t working
 
 Counseling with a support therapist who listens well and provides occasional unstructured validation or advice does not tend to help people experiencing symptoms of depression.
 
 However, some specific psychotherapy techniques may be effective.
 
 These may be even more beneficial if you receive them at the same time as you take antidepressant medications.
 
 ResearchTrusted Source suggests that combining psychotherapy and antidepressant treatment improves or resolves symptoms in people experiencing treatment-resistant depression better than taking antidepressants independently.
 
 According to the American Psychological Association (APA), most people experiencing treatment-resistant depression benefit from a combination of medication and psychotherapy.
 
 Cognitive behavioral therapy
 
 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on changing your mental and behavioral responses to stress.
 
 CBT is powerful because it also helps you respond to factors that contribute to depression. It may help you change negative thought patterns and engage in meaningful activities or behaviors.
 
 This type of therapy empowers you to act as your own therapist so you can continue helping yourself over the long term.
 
 One study looked at the effects of combining CBT and antidepressant medications. Those who received both were more than 3 timesTrusted Source as likely to show long-term improvements in depression symptoms as those who took just antidepressants.
 
 Even if you stop taking medication for depression symptoms, the skills you learned in CBT continue to help you throughout life.
 
 Brain stimulation
 
 Doctors reserve brain stimulation procedures as a last resort for people who have not responded well to multiple antidepressants or therapy.
 
 If you decide to try this treatment, a doctor will stimulate parts of your brain with electricity.
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the type of brain stimulation researchers have studied most. Healthcare professionals have used it since the early 1900s to treat mental health conditions.
 
 Although portrayals of ECT in pop culture have often been negative, studiesTrusted Source suggest that it can provide relief for many people who don’t respond to antidepressants.
 
 ECT is also very safe in its modern form — an important point to consider if you’re wondering whether you should get it.
 
 The APA generally recommends that doctors reserve ECT for people experiencing severe treatment-resistant depression, such as those who are experiencing suicidal thoughts or also experiencing psychosis.
 
 If ECT doesn’t work to resolve symptoms, your doctor may recommend trying other brain stimulation techniques, such as:
 
 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
 
 vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)
 
 deep brain stimulation
 
 Living with treatment-resistant depression
 
 There are many small steps you can take to help manage your symptoms of depression.
 
 Stick to your treatment plan
 
 Even if you feel better, it’s advisable to keep taking your medications as prescribed and continue going to therapy. Depression symptoms could return if you stop treatment.
 
 If you have concerns about your medications, such as side effects that you don’t like, your psychiatrist may have other options.
 
 Stress management techniques
 
 Therapy can help you develop skills to cope with stress in a healthy, productive way.
 
 It can also help you manage particular factors related to depression, such as negative thought patterns or lack of enjoyment or motivation.
 
 Self-care helps
 
 Research suggests that people who eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables are less likely to experience depression symptoms. It also recommends physical activity as a complement to antidepressant treatment.
 
 If you drink alcohol, smoke, or take recreational drugs, consider quitting. This may reduce symptoms of depression.
 
 If you feel you need support for a substance use disorder, your healthcare professional may help.
 
 Are you in a crisis or considering suicide?
 
 If you or someone you know is considering suicide or self-harm, help is available:
 
 Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24 hours a day at 800-273-8255.

 Recap
 
 If you’re experiencing treatment-resistant depression, you may feel frustrated and disheartened, but there is hope.
 
 Changing your antidepressant medication and getting counseling or therapy may help ease your symptoms.
 
 If you’ve tried multiple kinds of medications and your depression symptoms are still affecting your life, your healthcare professional may have other treatments available.

 Taking care of a newborn can be hard. You’re sleep deprived, tired, and probably feeling anxious from personal and social expectations on what comes next.
 
 This is natural. In fact, it’s how most people feel after welcoming a baby. So, why do you sense there’s something else going on?
 
 You cry often and without an apparent reason. You’re more irritable than usual, and sometimes you even feel like getting away from everyone — including your baby.
 
 And then, there’s the sudden guilt for feeling this way.
 
 Yes, something else might be going on: postpartum depression.
 
 Rest assured, you didn’t do anything to cause this. It’s your body and mind putting a filter on how you see yourself, the world, and your baby. But, with help, that filter can be lifted.
 
 A good first step is understanding what postpartum depression is. An important follow-up is opening up about your symptoms with family, friends, and healthcare professionals.
 
 What does postpartum depression feel like?
 
 You’ve finally got this precious baby that you’ve been expecting for so long. Yet, when you look at them, you don’t feel joy, like everyone expects you to — like you expected to.
 
 Instead, you feel immensely sad and even angry. Sometimes, you may even feel disinterested.
 
 You might look at your baby and feel… nothing. Then you start believing there might be something wrong with you, and this makes you feel worse.
 
 In reality, this isn’t who you are, and it’s not a reflection of you as a person or as a parent.
 
 Instead, this is postpartum depression. It’s a mental health condition that’s affecting how you think, feel, and behave.
 
 A combination of factors — most of them out of your control — have caused you to feel this way.
 
 In other words, postpartum depression isn’t the result of a character flaw, weakness, or lack of ability to raise a child.
 
 In fact, postpartum depression symptoms reportedly affect 1 in 8Trusted Source people who have given birth.
 
 The condition can impact all races, ages, and socioeconomic backgrounds. In some instances, other parents and caregivers who haven’t given birth also experience postpartum depression symptoms.
 
 Symptoms of postpartum depression typically appear within 4 weeks after childbirth. In some instances, they can also come on fast, even within the first 72 hours.
 
 In other cases, some symptoms might not appear until 6 months laterTrusted Source or even up to a year after delivery. This can sometimes make it difficult to identify as postpartum depression.
 
 Sometimes postpartum depression isn’t evident after your first birth but could develop after future pregnancies. Postpartum depression seems to resolve for other people in a few months, but if left untreated, symptoms can come back.
 
 It’s not uncommon to feel shame or guilt for experiencing postpartum depression — but the fact is that this isn’t happening because of something you did or didn’t do correctly.
 
 There are a few things you can do to manage your symptoms and feel better. But the first step is getting support from a health professional who can work with you to create a treatment plan and help you cope.
 
 What causes postpartum depression?
 
 Like other types of depression, there’s still no consensus on the exact cause of postpartum depression.
 
 Some researchers have proposed that it might be related to hormone levels. Some people might be more sensitive to the surge in hormones during pregnancy and the sudden dip in hormones right after giving birth.
 
 But it’s likely that postpartum depression is caused by a specific combination of physical and emotional factors.
 
 Some factors that may be associated with a higher probability of developing postpartum depression include:
 
 thyroid disorder or related conditions
 
 medical or family history of depression
 
 multiple pregnancies
 
 history of bipolar disorder or anxiety disorder
 
 weak support system or social isolation
 
 asthma
 
 teen pregnancy
 
 preterm labor
 
 sleep deprivation
 
 the recent loss of a loved one
 
 pregnancy and birth complications
 
 symptoms of depression during pregnancy
 
 alcohol and substance use
 
 Because there are still many other things that can play a role, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that you’re screened for symptoms of depression during and after pregnancy, regardless of the presence of contributing factors.
 
 Symptoms of postpartum depression
 
 The symptoms of postpartum depression can be very similar to those of other types of depression.
 
 Symptoms become intrusive, debilitating, and persistent to the point that they get in the way of you living your life and functioning.
 
 But not everyone experiences the same symptoms or with the same severity, which sometimes makes it difficult to diagnose or self-identify.
 
 If you start noticing some symptoms of postnatal depression, you might have a general feeling of “I can’t believe this is happening” or “I thought I’d be so happy, but now I don’t even feel close to my baby.”
 
 You might also wonder when it will end or what happens if these feelings don’t go away.
 
 It’s natural to have these concerns if things aren’t going the way you thought they would.
 
 Remember, this is not who you are, but instead, it’s postpartum depression — a mental health condition that’s manageable.
 
 General symptoms of postpartum depression include:
 
 feeling overwhelmed most of the time
 
 intense sadness and feelings of hopelessness
 
 crying for “no reason” and often
 
 desire to withdraw from your baby, partner, family members, and social situations
 
 feeling detached, disconnected, or uninterested in your baby
 
 feeling disconnected from your partner
 
 worrying you might hurt your baby
 
 worrying someone else might hurt your baby

 having extreme anxiety episodes
 
 experiencing anger or rage without an apparent trigger
 
 not being able to enjoy activities as you did before
 
 feeling guilt and shame
 
 acting irritable
 
 physical aches and pains
 
 recurrent suicidal thoughts
 
 This isn’t an all-inclusive list of symptoms. Postpartum depression doesn’t look the same way in everyone.
 
 Sometimes, there are subtle symptoms that might be missed but that affect parents and their children nonetheless.
 
 One of these subtle symptoms is the tendency to over-focus on negative thoughts. These thoughts could be about anything and everything, including yourself and your baby.
 
 This focus on the negative might lead you to misinterpret some cues from your baby. For example, a cry for comfort from the little one might become a nuisance to you and could make you leave the room.
 
 This, of course, is not your intention — but because of your depressed mood, this is how you feel. This can get in the way of you bonding with your baby and responding to their needs.
 
 Sometimes you might start obsessing about specific things. For instance, you might check the locks all the time, or verify every few minutes that the baby is safe. You might also feel you don’t want anyone else touching your baby.
 
 These signs and symptoms can last for a long period of time — from weeks to months. This is one of the reasons why it’s important you talk about it with family and healthcare professionals as soon as you notice them.
 
 When to call a doctor
 
 Treatment for postpartum depression is important in all cases, but it becomes a priority when:
 
 your symptoms are getting worse or more intense
 
 you have thoughts of hurting yourself, others, or your baby
 
 you’re having problems functioning or performing everyday tasks
 
 you’re having intense physical symptoms
 
 If you’re considering self-harm or suicide, you’re not alone. Help is available right now:

 Is it baby blues or postpartum depression?
 
 Commonly confused, postpartum depression is not the same as “baby blues.”
 
 Baby blues refers to a common feeling of irritability, worry, fatigue, and sadness during the first few days after giving birth.
 
 Some symptoms of baby blues include:
 
 waves of anxiety without any apparent trigger
 
 worrying about being good enough as a parent
 
 tearfulness
 
 doubting your own ability to handle your baby and the situation
 
 wondering when you’ll be able to return to your regular activities
 
 feeling overwhelmed by the needs of your baby or not knowing how to respond to those needs
 
 being concerned about your baby’s health
 
 being concerned about your relationship with your partner
 
 feeling uncomfortable in your own body or having difficulty accepting its changes
 
 Up to 80% of people who give birth experience symptoms of baby blues.
 
 The main difference between postpartum depression and baby blues is in intensity and duration.
 
 Symptoms of baby blues usually resolve on their own within the first 2 weeks after you give birth. They also tend to appear at times, but they might not be constant in your day.
 
 If the symptoms last longer than 2 weeks and get worse, you might be developing postpartum depression.
 
 Postpartum depression involves deeper feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and difficulty going about your daily tasks. Symptoms also last much longer than the initial 2 weeks and often require professional help.
 
 Is it postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis?
 
 Postpartum psychosis is rare and more severe than depression. It’s estimated to occur in just 1 to 5 people out of 1,000Trusted Source who have recently given birth.
 
 Symptoms of postpartum psychosis usually appear within the first 2 weeks after childbirth but can also show up after a few months. They involve losing touch with reality.
 
 Some postpartum psychosis symptoms are:
 
 hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others don’t)
 
 rapid changes in mood and emotions, usually from one extreme to the opposite
 
 agitation
 
 delusions (false beliefs)
 
 episodes of mania
 
 episodes of depression, similar to those of postpartum depression
 
 paranoia
 
 confusion and disorientation
 
 aggressive behavior
 
 refusal to sleep and eat
 
 Postpartum psychosis requires immediate medical attention. With timely treatment you can find ways to manage your symptoms.
 
 How is postpartum depression formally diagnosed?
 
 Postpartum depression is a mental health condition that only a trained professional can diagnose accurately.
 
 To do that, a mental health or medical professional will need information about the emotions, thoughts, and behaviors that are concerning you, and how long you’ve experienced them. They’ll also want to know about your personal and family medical history.
 
 This means that they might also order blood tests to rule out a physical reason for how you’re feeling. For example, an underactive thyroid could contribute to your symptoms.
 
 With this information, they’ll be able to distinguish between baby blues and postpartum depression or any other health condition.
 
 Additionally, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a commonly used tool to screen for symptoms of postpartum depression.
 
 Your healthcare team might suggest you take this 10-question scale if you’re feeling depressed or anxious.
 
 You could also take this scale on your own and bring the results to your therapist or doctor. But regardless of the score you get, if you still feel something’s not right, talking to a healthcare professional can help.
 
 Can postpartum depression be treated?
 
 Postpartum depression can be treated. The sooner you find support, the sooner you can work on relieving some of the symptoms you’re experiencing.
 
 If there’s an underlying condition that’s contributing to how you feel, your healthcare team will want to address that first. For example, balancing your thyroid hormone levels.
 
 When that’s done, talking to a mental health professional can also help.
 
 In general, postpartum depression is often treated with:
 
 interpersonal psychotherapy
 
 cognitive behavioral therapy
 
 bright light therapy
 
 electroconvulsive therapy
 
 medications
 
 You may wonder if you can take antidepressants if you’re breastfeeding. Even though not all antidepressants can be prescribed while you’re lactating, some of them have little risk of side effects for your baby.
 
 Talking with a healthcare professional can help you weigh the risks versus benefits of specific drugs. Including your baby’s pediatrician in this conversation can provide you with additional insight.
 
 In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvedTrusted Source the first drug specifically for postpartum depression. The generic name is brexanolone. It’s given as an IV infusion for 2 1/2 days or 60 hours.
 
 Clinical trials of brexanolone suggested that the drug can work for a person up to a month after one infusion. There’s the potential for some side effects that your doctor might want to talk with you about.
 
 In general, drugs with a short half-life are considered the safest for you and your baby. Half-life refers to the amount of time that one-half of the drug dose takes to leave your system.
 
 Treatment is important not only for someone living with postpartum depression — but also for children of parents who feel detached, anxious, or depressed. Children may have a greater chance of developing psychological or relationship challenges of their own.
 
 Your healthcare team might also suggest family or relationship therapy. This could help those closest to you understand what you’re going through and help you out.
 
 If left untreated, postpartum depression can last for months or years. With the right treatment, you can cope and start functioning better.
 
 Self-help strategies
 
 While the most effective way of treating postpartum depression requires the support of a healthcare team, you can be an active participant in your recovery.
 
 These are some ways you can start supporting your treatment, particularly at times when you feel low.
 
 Sleep as much as you can
 
 This is probably the most important thing you need to do after giving birth.
 
 Research has suggested that poor sleep quality increases the risk for severe postpartum symptoms.
 
 Health professionals recommend that every adult get at least 7 hours of sleep within a 24-hour period — which, as a new parent, is easier said than done.
 
 To help you sleep better, you can:
 
 make sure your room is at a comfortable temperature and as dark as possible
 
 listen to relaxing music or nature sounds during the day and when trying to sleep
 
 avoid caffeine
 
 If you’re having a hard time sleeping, consider talking to your doctor for additional ideas that work better for your specific situation. Consider leaning on your partner, family, and friends to get in a nap when you can.
 
 Save time for yourself
 
 Relaxation is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.
 
 Even though you might find it challenging at first, saving time for relaxation, if possible, is one of the most effective ways to support your well-being.
 
 This can include time to:
 
 shower or take a bath
 
 eat your favorite food
 
 watch an episode of your favorite series
 
 read a few pages of a nice book
 
 have a cup of tea
 
 watch a sunset
 
 It can be a few minutes or as long as possible for you. Just deciding to take care of yourself will help you feel better.
 
 Ask and accept help from others
 
 Postpartum depression can distort the way you see yourself and others, or add a sense of guilt about how you feel. But you’re doing the best you can — even when you don’t feel this is the case.
 
 Asking for help doesn’t mean you’re failing or weak. It gives you the opportunity to get support and feel loved, which can also help you feel better in time.
 
 You could ask a relative, neighbor, friend, or anyone else you trust to:
 
 stay around for 30 minutes while you take a relaxing bath or go for a walk
 
 help you prepare and pack meals for the new week, so you always have a meal at hand
 
 take a walk with you around your neighborhood
 
 join you on a video call just to chat
 
 pick up a few groceries or help you order them online
 
 watch your baby while you pamper yourself at a hair or nail salon
 
 run important errands for you
 
 bring their baby to spend some time together with yours
 
 help you find the information you need to make a decision (for example, finding a therapist online or printing a few questions to discuss with your doctor)
 
 Don’t skip any meals
 
 It may sound like an odyssey to get all 3 meals or more during a busy day. But eating regularly is very important for your health and your baby’s.
 
 Grabbing a bite every few hours can help you take short breaks and keep your body alert and strong.
 
 Although it’s important to indulge in your favorites once in a while, try to keep your diet full of fresh and healthy foods as well.
 
 Move around
 
 This may sound like the last thing you want right now. You may feel fatigued as it is with all the things you need to do. But taking at least 15 minutes each day to move freely and exercise can give your body the endorphins it needs to feel better.
 
 You can find an easy at-home exercise routine, or just put your baby in the stroller and go for a walk.
 
 The goal is to get your body in action every day for as long as you can.
 
 Other ways you can exercise include:
 
 doing a few squats while heating a meal
 
 stretching on the floor while your baby is on the mat or sleeping
 
 doing a couple of lunges while you walk toward the bathroom
 
 dancing your way around your home
 
 joining a mommy-and-me class
 
 Before doing any of these, or any other form of exercise, it might be a good idea to discuss with your health provider the best options for you.
 
 Breathe
 
 This one sounds like a given, but it’s not. It’s likely that when you’re feeling anxious, stressed out, or sad, your breathing pattern turns constricted. This, in turn, can increase the intensity of your symptoms.
 
 Take some time, every hour, to just pause for 1–3 minutes, and breathe deeply. This is particularly important at times when you’re feeling overwhelmed.
 
 To do this breathing exercise:
 
 Close your eyes or just focus on a wall, window, or anything else in the room.
 
 Take a deep breath in through your nose and hold for 3 seconds.
 
 Breathe out slowly through your mouth as you feel your back and shoulders relax.
 
 Take as many seconds to breathe in as to breathe out. For example, breathe in for a count of 5 seconds. Hold for 3 seconds. Breathe out for a count of 5 seconds.
 
 Repeat this exercise up to 10 times every time you do it.
 
 Let the light in
 
 Decreased sun exposure is linked to an increase in depression symptoms.
 
 If you can, try getting at least 30 minutes of sunshine every day (weather permitting). Remember to ask your baby’s pediatrician about the best ways to protect them from the sun.
 
 It’s also important to let natural light come in through the windows during the day, and at times when you’re not trying to sleep.
 
 If you feel getting sunshine every day is challenging, you may want to consider a light therapy box for artificial sunlight.
 
 Next steps
 
 Postpartum depression can be challenging, especially when facing the normal challenges of caring for a newborn.
 
 Thankfully, help is available and coping is possible.
 
 No matter how intense your symptoms are, once you reach out for treatment, you’ll be on your way to mental wellness.

 Next steps
 
 Living with depression is common, but it can also be difficult, particularly when the condition goes untreated.
 
 The effects of depression are often a challenge for both people living with the condition and their loved ones. In fact, more than 264 millionTrusted Source people in the world experience symptoms of the condition.
 
 The common misconceptions about depression don’t make it any easier. It’s not about feeling sad or down, not trying hard enough, or something you can put on hold at will.
 
 Depression is a mental health condition that affects all aspects of your life. Symptoms usually last two weeks or more, and they can go on for years in some cases.
 
 The condition doesn’t feel or look the same for everyone. It’s not uncommon to look at a list of depression symptoms and not identify with some of them. Your experience is nonetheless valid.
 
 Regardless of how you live with depression and its effects, help is available and can improve your quality of life. But what happens when depression goes untreated?
 
 Physical side effects of depression
 
 Despite being a mental health condition, depression can still affect the rest of your body.
 
 Physical side effects of depression usually appear progressively and sometimes for no obvious reason. At first, you might not even associate your physical symptoms with how you feel.
 
 When you have depression, you might begin feeling very tired even after a good night’s sleep. You could also experience aches and pains without any apparent cause.
 
 For example, you might feel as if you’re coming down with the flu, but you never get flu symptoms beyond fatigue and body aches.
 
 Depression might also affect your sexual life, decreasing your libido or sexual performance. Sometimes you won’t feel interested at all. Other times, you’ll feel too tired to engage.
 
 These are some of the most common effects of depression on your body:
 
 chronic pain
 
 chronic inflammation
 
 headaches or migraines
 
 cramps
 
 constipation or diarrhea
 
 nausea and vomiting
 
 chronic fatigue that doesn’t go away after resting
 
 changes in sleep patterns
 
 changes in weight
 
 changes in appetite
 
 decreased sex drive or dyspareunia (pain during sex)
 
 increased chance of autoimmune disorders
 
 Depression can also increase your chance of developing physical conditions.
 
 For example, a 2014 literature reviewTrusted Source suggested that depression is linked to a significantly greater chance of myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease.
 
 One of the greatest challenges with the physical effects of depression is that they, in turn, might make your other symptoms worse. For example, not being able to sleep can lead to more aches and pains.
 
 Psychosocial side effects of depression
 
 The side effects of depression on the brain can, in turn, affect your emotional well-being. This not only includes your favorite activities and your job but also your personal and professional relationships or activities.
 
 When you live with untreated depression, you may notice your productivity decline. This could affect you at work or school.
 
 You could also experience the effects of depression on attention and memory performance. It might be difficult for you to recall newly learned information, for example.
 
 Untreated depression might also lead you to isolation. You may feel like staying home more often and start passing on gatherings with close friends or family.
 
 Keeping up with your social connections could make you feel overwhelmed and drained.
 
 Other psychosocial effects of depression include:
 
 loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or hobbies
 
 harder time concentrating on your tasks
 
 feeling frustrated, restless, or irritable without any apparent reason
 
 persistent anxiety or sadness that’s not necessarily connected to a specific event
 
 feeling helpless, vulnerable, guilty, or worthless
 
 having a pessimistic or hopeless outlook about your life
 
 difficulty with decision-making
 
 When to seek immediate help
 
 Treating depression is advisable in every case but it becomes a priority if you:
 
 think about hurting yourself or others
 
 have suicidal thoughts and fantasies
 
 don’t have the energy or will to fulfill your duties (e.g., taking care of your children)
 
 feel your symptoms are worsening

 Is depression a disability?
 
 For some, depression can be a debilitating mental health condition. It can make it difficult for you to get out of bed in the morning or have a productive and fulfilling day.
 
 With this in mind, depression is recognized in some cases as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This makes it possible for people living with severe depression to have accommodations made for them at work or allows them to receive financial support.
 
 ADA resources
 
 For help receiving financial assistance for depression, visit USA.gov.
 
 If you believe that you or someone you know is being discriminated against at work over a depression diagnosis, you can file an ADA complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice here.
 
 Can the effects of depression be reversed?
 
 Depression is fully manageable and treatable, and recovery is possible.
 
 If you’ve experienced untreated depression for a long time, some effects might not be reversed. For example, chronic inflammation in your body might have already caused some physical changes.
 
 This is not always the case, though. Some effects and symptoms of depression can be fully reversed.
 
 Seeking the help of a health professional might help diminish the effects of depression on your body. It can also help you manage your current symptoms and prevent future occurrences.
 
 How is depression treated?
 
 There are different types of depression that may require specific treatment plans.
 
 In general, side effects of depression can be treated with:
 
 Medication. Antidepressants are a common form of treatment for depression. Consider discussing the side effects of depression medication with your health care team.
 
 Therapy. Counseling for people with depression is often built on evidence-based approaches like:
 
 interpersonal therapy (IPT)
 
 cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
 
 acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
 
 mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)
 
 Brain stimulation therapy. This type of therapy may include electroconvulsive therapy, vagus nerve stimulation, or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. It might help you cope with some of the chronic effects of depression.
 
 Taking care of yourself
 
 Coping with depression symptoms sometimes begins with small lifestyle adjustments. This could complement the efforts of traditional treatment.
 
 There are some things that you can do in your daily life to help you or someone close to you better manage this condition.
 
 For example, you could:
 
 Move more often. Consider adding a few minutes of exercise and activity to your daily routine. Staying active will help you feel better in time.
 
 Follow a nutrient-rich diet. One 2017 studyTrusted Source found that people who followed diets rich in fruits and vegetables carried a lower chance of developing depression.
 
 Keep connected with friends and relatives. This could include spending some time on the phone, video calls, or having a cup of coffee together.
 
 Open up. If possible, talk about your feelings and thoughts with someone you trust. This might be challenging, but explaining your symptoms to other people might help them provide you the support you need.
 
 Set realistic expectations. This not only goes for your personal and professional life but also for your treatment.
 
 Learn more about depression. Understanding this condition is key to living with it.
 
 Set goals. Setting daily or weekly goals that are meaningful to you might help. A goal could be as simple as calling a friend, walking to your local park, or spending time outdoors every day.
 
 Next steps
 
 Depression can sometimes have profound effects on your mind and body.
 
 Symptoms and side effects of depression can be managed with the help of a mental health professional. When treatment is sought, it can be possible to improve your quality of life.

 How to help
 
 Mourning is an intimate and unique experience for each of us. There’s no manual on how to cope with loss and certainly no right or wrong way to go through the stages of grief that might come from it.
 
 Jovo Jovanovic/Stocksy United
 
 If you or someone you love are going through a loss, the new emotions may feel overwhelming and confusing.
 
 Feeling this way is natural and even necessary. These emotions are forward steps in the healing journey, even when it doesn’t feel like it at the moment.
 
 Healing from a loss is possible, but it does take time and patience. Even if you’re having a particularly hard time with it, resources like counseling and support groups can help you cope.
 
 The Kübler-Ross model on grieving
 
 In an effort to better understand the grieving process, many mental health experts and researchers have dedicated years to studying loss and the emotions that come with it.
 
 One of these experts was Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a Swiss American psychiatrist. She created the Kübler-Ross model, the theory of the five stages of grief and loss.
 
 In her 1969 book, “On Death and Dying,” Kübler-Ross examined the five most common emotional reactions to loss:
 
 denial
 
 anger
 
 bargaining
 
 depression
 
 acceptance
 
 Originally, Kübler-Ross referred to them as the “five stages of death.” This was because she was working with terminally ill patients at the time, and these were the common emotions they had regarding their own mortality.
 
 Years after her first book, Kübler-Ross adapted and extended her model to include other kinds of loss. The five stages of death became the five stages of grief.
 
 This grief can come in many forms and from different reasons. Everyone, from all walks of life and across cultures, experiences loss and grief at some point.
 
 Mourning doesn’t come only from dealing with your own death or the death of a loved one. Mourning can also come as a result of an illness, the end of a close relationship, or even the end of a project or dream.
 
 Grief can similarly come from a perceived or real change in your life. For example, moving to a new city, school, or job, transitioning into a new age group, or staying in isolation because of a pandemic.
 
 In other words, there’s no written-in-stone list of “valid” reasons to grieve.
 
 What matters is how you feel. And there are no right or wrong feelings regarding a loss.
 
 Going through the 5 stages of grief
 
 Exploring the five stages of grief and loss could help you understand and put into context where you are in your own grieving process and what you feel.
 
 Similarly, if you’re concerned or want to understand someone else’s grieving process, remember that there’s no one way of going through it. Everyone mourns differently.
 
 You could go through many intense emotions, or you could seemingly not react at all. Both responses are valid and not uncommon.
 
 How much time you spend navigating the stages of grief also varies from person to person. It might take you hours, months, or longer to process a loss and heal from it.
 
 You might not experience all these stages of grief or in the order listed above. You could go back and forth from one stage to another.
 
 You may even skip all these emotions and process your loss differently altogether. The five stages of grief are supposed to serve you as a reference, not as a rule.
 
 Denial
 
 For some people, this may be the first response to loss.
 
 Denial is a common defense mechanism. It may help you buffer the immediate shock of the hurtful situation.
 
 As an immediate reaction, you might doubt the reality of the loss at first.
 
 A few examples of this type of denial are:
 
 If you’re facing the death of a loved one, you might find yourself fantasizing someone will call to say there’s been a mistake and nothing really happened.
 
 If you’re dealing with a breakup, you might convince yourself your partner will soon regret leaving and come back to you.
 
 If you lost your job, you might feel your former boss will offer you the position back after they realize they’ve made a mistake.
 
 After this first reaction of shock and denial, you may go numb for a while.
 
 At some point, you could feel like nothing matters to you anymore. Life as you once knew it has changed. It might be difficult to feel you can move on.
 
 This is a natural reaction that helps you process the loss in your own time. By going numb, you’re giving yourself time to explore at your own pace the changes you’re going through.
 
 Denial is a temporary response that carries you through the first wave of pain. Eventually, when you’re ready, the feelings and emotions you have denied will resurface, and your healing journey will continue.
 
 Anger
 
 Sometimes pain takes other forms. According to Kübler-Ross, pain from a loss is often redirected and expressed as anger.
 
 Feeling intensely angry might surprise you or your loved ones, but it’s not uncommon. This anger serves a purpose.
 
 It might be particularly overwhelming for some people to feel anger because, in many cultures, anger is a feared or rejected emotion. You might be more used to avoiding it than confronting it.
 
 During the anger stage of grief, you might start asking questions like “Why me?” or “What did I do to deserve this?”
 
 You could also feel suddenly angry at inanimate objects, strangers, friends, or family members. You might feel angry at life itself.
 
 It’s not rare to also feel anger toward the situation or person you lost. Rationally, you might understand the person isn’t to blame. Emotionally, however, you may resent them for causing you pain or for leaving you.
 
 At some point, you might also feel guilty for being angry. This could make you angrier.
 
 Try reminding yourself that underneath your anger is pain. And even if it might not feel like it, this anger is necessary for healing.
 
 Anger might also be a way to reconnect to the world after isolating yourself from it during the denial stage. When you’re numb, you disconnect from everyone. When you’re angry, you connect, even if through this emotion.
 
 But anger isn’t the only emotion you might experience during this stage. Irritability, bitterness, anxiety, rage, and impatience are just some other ways you might cope with your loss. It’s all part of the same process.

 Bargaining
 
 Bargaining is a way to hold on to hope in a situation of intense pain.
 
 You might think to yourself that you’re willing to do anything and sacrifice everything if your life is restored to how it was before the loss.
 
 During this internal negotiation, you could find yourself thinking in terms of “what if” or “if only”: what if I did XYZ, then everything will go back to normal; if only I had done something differently to prevent the loss.
 
 Guilt might be an accompanying emotion during this stage as you inadvertently might be trying to regain some control, even if at your own expense.
 
 All these emotions and thoughts aren’t uncommon. As hard as it might feel, this helps you heal as you confront the reality of your loss.
 
 Depression
 
 Just as in all the other stages of grief, depression is experienced in different ways. There’s no right or wrong way to go about it, nor is there a deadline to overcome it.
 
 In this instance, depression isn’t a sign of a mental health condition. Instead, it’s a natural and appropriate response to grief.
 
 During the depression stage, you start facing your present reality and the inevitability of the loss you’ve experienced. Understandably, this realization may lead you to feel intense sadness and despair.
 
 This intense sadness could cause you to feel different in other aspects too. You could feel:
 
 fatigued
 
 vulnerable
 
 confused and distracted
 
 not wanting to move on
 
 not hungry or wanting to eat
 
 not able or willing to get ready in the morning
 
 not able to enjoy what you once did
 
 This is all typically temporary and a direct response to your grieving process.
 
 As overwhelming as it may feel at this point, this stage is a necessary part of your healing journey.
 
 Acceptance
 
 Reaching acceptance isn’t necessarily about being OK with what happened. Depending on your experience, it might be understandable if you don’t ever feel this way.
 
 Acceptance is more about how you acknowledge the losses you’ve experienced, how you learn to live with them, and how you readjust your life accordingly.
 
 You might feel more comfortable reaching out to friends and family during this stage, but it’s also natural to feel you prefer to withdraw at times.
 
 You may also feel like you accept the loss at times and then move to another stage of grief again. This back-and-forth between stages is natural and a part of the healing process.
 
 In time, you may eventually find yourself stationed at this stage for long periods of time.
 
 That doesn’t mean you’ll never feel sadness or anger again toward your loss, but your long-term perspective about it and how you live with this reality will be different.
 
 Other possible stages of grief
 
 The five stages of grief proposed by Kübler-Ross have served as a framework for many mental health professionals working with the grief process.
 
 Some of these professionals, such as British psychiatrist John Bowlby, have developed their own work around the emotional responses to loss. Others, including Kübler-Ross herself, have adapted and extended the original five-stage model.
 
 This adaptation is usually known as the Kübler-Ross Change Curve. It extends the five core stages of grief to seven overlapping stages:
 
 Shock. Intense and sometimes paralyzing surprise at the loss.
 
 Denial. Disbelief and the need to look for evidence to confirm the loss.
 
 Anger and frustration. A mix between acknowledgment that some things have changed and anger toward this change.
 
 Depression. Lack of energy and intense sadness.

 Common misconceptions about grieving
 
 Because everyone mourns differently and for different reasons, sometimes you might feel your own grieving process isn’t going “according to the norm.”
 
 But remember, there’s no such thing as a right or wrong way of coping with a loss.
 
 These might be some of the thoughts that could cross your mind when looking at your own or someone else’s way of grieving.
 
 1. ‘I am doing it wrong’
 
 One of the most common misconceptions about grieving is that everyone goes through it in the same way.
 
 When it comes to healing from a loss, there’s no correct way of doing it. You might find it useful to remind yourself there’s no “I should be feeling this way.”
 
 Grieving isn’t about going over or following a set list of steps. It’s a unique and multidimensional healing journey.
 
 2. ‘I should be feeling…’
 
 Not everyone experiences all the above-mentioned stages or even goes through these emotions the same way.
 
 For example, maybe the depression stage feels more like irritability than sadness for you. And denial could be more of a sense of shock and disbelief than an actual expectation that something out of the blue will fix the loss.
 
 The emotions used to contextualize the stages of grief aren’t the only ones you’ll experience. You might not even experience them at all, and that’s natural too.
 
 This is no indication that your healing journey is faulty in some way. Your healing experience is unique to you and valid nonetheless.
 
 3. ‘This goes first’
 
 Remember, there’s no specific or linear order for the stages of grief.
 
 You could move along the stages one by one, or you could go back and forth. Some days you might feel very sad, and the very next day you could wake up feeling hopeful. Then you could go back to feeling sad. Some days you might even feel both!
 
 In the same way, denial isn’t necessarily the first emotion you’ll experience. Maybe your first emotional reaction is anger or depression.
 
 This is natural and part of the healing process.
 
 4. ‘It’s taking too long’
 
 Coping with a loss is ultimately a deeply personal and singular experience. Many factors affect how long it takes.
 
 Some people navigate through grief in a few days. Others take months or longer to process their loss.
 
 You might find it useful to not set any deadlines to your process.
 
 In grief, you’ll experience some of these emotions in waves of intensity. In time, you’ll notice this intensity decrease.
 
 If you feel your emotions stay or increase in intensity and frequency, this might be a good time to seek professional support.
 
 5. ‘I’m depressed’
 
 Going through the stages of grief, particularly the depression stage, isn’t equivalent to clinical depression. There’s a distinction between having clinical depression and grieving.
 
 This means that even though some symptoms might be similar, there are still key differences between both.
 
 For example, in grief, the intense sadness will lessen in intensity and frequency as time goes by. You might even experience this sadness at the same time you find temporary relief in happy memories from times before the loss.
 
 In clinical depression, on the other hand, without the proper treatment, your mood would stay negative or worsen with time. It would likely affect your self-esteem. You may rarely experience feelings of pleasure or happiness.
 
 This doesn’t mean there isn’t a possibility you could develop clinical depression during the grieving process. If your emotions progressively increase in intensity and frequency, reach out for support.
 
 When to reach out for help
 
 If you’re experiencing intense grief and feel unsure about how to cope with it, reaching out for help can provide comfort and support.
 
 Any reason that’s valid to you is a good reason for reaching out for help.
 
 Other instances in which you might want to seek help processing your loss include the following:
 
 You need to go back to school or work and have a hard time going about your daily tasks. For example, you’re having trouble concentrating.
 
 You’re the sole or main guardian or support source for someone else. For example, you’re a single parent or someone else’s caretaker.
 
 You’re experiencing physical discomfort or pain.
 
 You’re skipping meals or medications because you don’t feel like getting up or doing anything.
 
 Your emotions are increasing in intensity and frequency instead of coming in waves or lessening over time.
 
 You’ve thought about hurting others or yourself.
 
 If you or someone you know is considering self-harm, you’re not alone. Help is available right now:
 
 Call a crisis hotline, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.
 
 Text HOME to the Crisis Text Line at 741741.
 
 There are a few other ways to reach out for help, depending on what is available to you.
 
 Friends and family
 
 Talking with friends or relatives might give you a sense of relief.
 
 Verbally expressing how you feel can sometimes release some of the inner turmoil you might be experiencing.
 
 Sometimes you might not feel like talking but instead prefer to have silent company.
 
 Expressing your needs to others can allow them to help you in the way you feel is best for your situation.
 
 Support groups
 
 Engaging in support groups can be helpful too. There are local support groups as well as online support groups.
 
 You can connect to others in the group who have gone through or are going through similar losses. They can direct you to further resources as well.
 
 Support groups can also become a safe space where you can express yourself without feeling judged or pressured if you feel that might be the case when talking to somebody else.
 
 Mental health professionals
 
 Grief counseling and therapy are two ways to work with a mental health professional who might support your own process.
 
 If you have insurance, call your insurer to determine whether this grief counseling is covered under your policy and, if so, under which conditions.
 
 If your insurance doesn’t cover counseling sessions, your primary care doctor might be able to offer some support or guidance.
 
 If you don’t have health insurance or aren’t covered for this service, you could try searching for a local organization that provides grief counseling at a low or no charge.
 
 Many national mental health organizations, like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), have local or regional chapters. Calling them directly might give you access to some of this information and their specific grief support services.
 
 How to help someone who is grieving
 
 You’ve taken the first step by just wondering how you can help your loved one.
 
 Here are some ways you can support them now and in the future.
 
 1. Listen
 
 Perhaps one of the main legacies from Elisabeth Kübler-Ross and her work is the importance of listening to the grieving person.
 
 You might have the best intentions and want to provide comforting words. But in some instances, the best support comes from just being there and making it clear that you’re available to listen to whatever — and whenever — they want to share.
 
 It’s also important to accept it if your loved one doesn’t want to talk with you. Give them time and space.
 
 2. Reach out
 
 Not everyone knows how to comfort others. It might be intimidating or overwhelming seeing someone you care about have a rough time.
 
 But don’t let these fears stop you from offering help or from being there. Lead with empathy, and the rest will follow.
 
 3. Be practical
 
 Look for ways to ease the weight off your loved one’s shoulders. Explore the areas they might need help managing while they process their loss.
 
 This could mean helping with food preparation or grocery shopping, organizing their room or house, or picking up their children from school.
 
 4. Don’t assume
 
 You might want to verbally offer your support and be attentive to whatever they tell you might help them feel better. But avoid assuming or guessing “which step” of the process they’re going through at the moment.
 
 A smiley face or no tears don’t necessarily mean they’re not grieving. A change in their physical appearance doesn’t mean they’re depressed.
 
 Wait for them to express how they feel, if they’re ready, and go from there.
 
 5. Search for resources
 
 You might have the clarity of mind and the energy to browse local support groups and organizations, call an insurance company, and find a mental health professional.
 
 The decision of reaching out for this kind of help is, of course, entirely up to the grieving person. But having the information at hand might save time whenever they’re prepared or willing to take it.

 What it is
 
 Timing
 
 Symptoms
 
 Treatment options and strategies
 
 Seasonal affective disorder, or seasonal depression, is triggered by the changing seasons. It’s more common during fall and winter but can also occur in the summer.
 
 It’s not uncommon for people to experience changes in mood — times when you feel sad and maybe not quite like yourself.
 
 Sometimes these mood changes coincide with the changing of the seasons, and sometimes they can be a sign of major depressive disorder (MDD) with seasonal pattern, more commonly known as seasonal affective disorder or seasonal depression.
 
 This condition is common and especially prevalent in more northern regions where the days are shorter and the nights longer.
 
 Still, there are many ways to treat seasonal depression and many options that you can try on your own to help keep symptoms at bay.
 
 What is seasonal affective disorder?
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or seasonal depression are older terms for major depressive disorder (MDD) with seasonal pattern. However, since the older terms are more commonly known, they’re used throughout this article.
 
 We avoid using the abbreviation “SAD,” as it may be confused with social anxiety disorder.
 
 The condition is characterized by feelings of sadness and depression that occur with the changing seasons, most commonly in the fall or winter months when the temperatures begin to drop and the days grow shorter.
 
 The symptoms subside on their own as you transition out of the season that affects you.
 
 Because most people experience these shifts in mood during winter, it’s sometimes referred to as winter depression.
 
 If your symptoms are less severe, the episode can be referred to as the “winter blues.” The official reference for this milder version is winter-type or winter-pattern subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder.
 
 Growing researchTrusted Source has found that in some countries, notably in North America, there’s a clear connection between latitude, or how far north or south you live, and the occurrence of seasonal depression.
 
 In other parts of the world, like parts of Europe, this connection is less clear.
 
 Overall, it’s estimated that between 1% and 10%Trusted Source of people experience seasonal depression. This can vary by country.
 
 Some researchTrusted Source has found that 20% of people in the United Kingdom experience winter blues, while 2% experience winter depression.
 
 In Canada, the numbers are 15% for winter blues and 2%–6% for winter depression. Plus, in the United States, about 1% of people living in Florida experience seasonal depression, compared with 9% of Alaska’s population.
 
 Women are 4 times more likelyTrusted Source to experience seasonal affective disorder than men, and the condition often begins when you’re between ages 18 and 30.

 Does seasonal affective disorder occur only in the winter?
 
 Though symptoms in winter are much more common, some people experience changes in mood at the onset of summer.
 
 This is known as summer-pattern or summer-type seasonal affective disorder, summer depression, or in its milder form, “summer blues.”
 
 Winter depression is thought to be caused by a lack of sunlight, whereas summer depression may be triggered by heat, humidity, and too much light exposure, which may affect your sleep-wake cycle.
 
 Though statistics on the prevalence of summer depression are not as easily found as those for winter depression, it’s estimated that about 10% of people with seasonal depression experience it in the spring or summer.
 
 Plus, it can be observed that summer depression may be more common in some regions with warmer climates and possibly less access to air-conditioning.
 
 For example, an early study in the Netherlands found that only 0.1% of participants experienced the symptoms of summer depression, compared with 3% for winter depression.
 
 In comparison, a 2000 study of Chinese college students noted that summer depression was more common than winter depression, with 7.5%, compared with 5.6%.
 
 Similarly, in an early study conducted in Thailand, the prevalence for summer depression and summer blues were 6.19% and 8.25%, respectively, compared with 1.03% for winter depression. Only 97 people were included in the study.

 What are the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder?
 
 Seasonal depression is considered a type of MDD. Some of the signs and symptoms of seasonal depression are the same as those you might experience with other types of major depressive disorder.
 
 Winter and summer depression also have some specific symptoms, which will be outlined below.
 
 Keep in mind that not everyone experiences all of the symptoms listed.
 
 Symptoms of major depression may include:
 
 feeling depressed nearly every day for most of the day
 
 losing interest in activities you enjoyed in the past
 
 changes in appetite or weight
 
 sleep problems
 
 feeling agitated or sluggish
 
 low energy
 
 experiencing a sense of hopelessness or worthlessness
 
 having difficulty concentrating
 
 experiencing frequent thoughts of death or suicide
 
 Symptoms of winter depression
 
 For winter depression, additional symptoms may include:
 
 oversleeping (hypersomnia)
 
 overeating
 
 craving carbs
 
 weight gain
 
 social withdrawal or a desire to “hibernate”
 
 Symptoms of summer depression
 
 Specific symptoms for summer depression may include:
 
 trouble sleeping (insomnia)
 
 a lack of appetite that may lead to weight loss
 
 agitation and restlessness
 
 anxiety
 
 episodes of violent behavior
 
 How is seasonal affective disorder treated?
 
 If you’re experiencing symptoms of seasonal depression, reach out to a doctor or mental health professional to discuss your treatment options, which may involve a combination of therapy, medications, and coping strategies.
 
 Strategies that may help with winter depression
 
 Get as much natural light as possible
 
 If you experience winter depression, increasing your daily exposure to as much natural light as possible can be helpful.
 
 You might find getting as much sunlight during the winter months as you can helpful.
 
 If you can, take a walk throughout the day or sit next to a south-facing window at your office, in a classroom, or at home. This will increase your sunlight exposure.
 
 Exercising next to a window or outdoors when possible is another activity that may help.
 
 Consider light therapy
 
 Light therapy can be an effective treatment for seasonal affective disorder.
 
 You can purchase specialized light therapy lighting boxes — sometimes called “SAD lamps” — for your home or office. It’s often recommended to sit in front of these lightboxes for about 30 to 60 minutes a day.
 
 Light therapy is thought to improve seasonal depression. The increased exposure to light may:
 
 cause your brain to reduce the production of the hormone melatonin, which makes you sleepy
 
 increase the production of the hormone serotonin, which affects your mood
 
 Though light therapy is recognizedTrusted Source as a first-line treatment for seasonal affective disorder, the lamps can be a bit pricy.
 
 Some insurances may cover the cost of the light therapy box, especially if your healthcare provider recommends light therapy. If you have medical insurance, then checking with your insurance provider is a good idea.
 
 Also, inexpensive alternatives are available. You can replace commonly used light bulbs in your home with brighter full spectrum (also known as broad spectrum) light bulbs.
 
 The bulbs cost more than regular light bulbs, but their light is similar to natural sunlight.
 
 Maintain your sleep schedule and routine
 
 If you can, maintain your schedule and routine, which may help keep depression at bay.
 
 A regular pattern of sleep is most important to maintain.
 
 It may be helpful, for instance, to have your bedroom lights on a timer to turn on a half-hour before you wake. This may help in waking at a regular time every morning when it’s still dark outside in the winter months.
 
 Exercise
 
 Exercising regularly may help boost your mood, which can be especially helpful if you have mild to moderate depression.
 
 For adults, aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week, if you can.
 
 It’s important to pick an activity you enjoy, so you’re more likely to stick with it.
 
 If you can, pick an outdoor activity like walking briskly, running, skiing, or sledding, but any type of physical exercise can be helpful.
 
 Eat a balanced diet
 
 Overeating and, particularly, craving carbs are common symptoms of winter depression. High sugar foods and carbs are known to give you a short boost of energy.
 
 There’s nothing wrong with enjoying a tasty treat from time to time, but try to eat a balanced diet rich in lean protein, fruits, and vegetables. These foods contain nutrients and compounds that may positively affect mood.
 
 For example, there’s some researchTrusted Source on the potential effects of omega-3s in relieving the severity of depressive symptoms.
 
 Fatty fish is particularly rich in omega-3s. The fatty acids can also be found in plant foods like seeds and nuts, though the type of omega-3s in plant foods aren’t as active in your body.
 
 To help you choose healthier foods, consider putting them in plain sight:
 
 Place a bowl of fruit in your kitchen where you can easily see it.
 
 Keep small containers with nuts or seeds by your work desk instead of high-carb sweets.
 
 Strategies that may help with summer depression
 
 Spend time in darkened rooms
 
 Unlike winter depression, which seems to be triggered by a lack of sunlight, summer depression may be caused by too much sun exposure, which may affect your sleep-wake cycle.
 
 If you experience symptoms of summer depression, consider limiting your time outside. If you can, spend more time inside, preferably in darkened rooms.
 
 Still, it may be important to find a balance between seeking light exposure and avoiding it. Getting too little natural light may affect your mood.
 
 Try to cool down
 
 If heat seems to trigger your onset of summer depression, it may be important to find ways to stay cool.
 
 If you have one, using an air-conditioning unit can be beneficial.
 
 Another option, if possible, is to consider is going to locations with air-conditioning running, such as supermarkets, malls, movie theaters, or libraries.
 
 You can also cool your home at night by opening windows if you don’t have air-conditioning.
 
 Exercise
 
 Regular exercise can help treat mild to moderate depression. It may also be an effective strategy in managing your summer depression.
 
 However, since too much sun exposure and heat could trigger your symptoms, you may want to opt for indoor activities, such as working out at a gym with air-conditioning, swimming at an indoor pool, or trying a yoga class (just maybe not hot yoga).
 
 What if these strategies don’t work?
 
 If you start with coping strategies and techniques and they don’t seem to relieve your symptoms alone, your doctor may recommend psychotherapy or medications.
 
 Often, a combination of therapy, medication, and self-care strategies will be the most effective for treating seasonal affective disorder, similar to treating other types of depression.
 
 No matter what, don’t be afraid of speaking with your healthcare provider about your symptoms. Together, you can work to find the right treatment options for you.
 
 Coping with suicidal thoughts
 
 If you’re in crisis or experiencing suicidal thoughts, help is always available.
 
 The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at 800-273-8255.
 
 If you’re not in the United States, you can find a helpline in your country at Befrienders Worldwide.
 
 You can also call or visit your nearest emergency room or psychiatric care center to speak with a mental health professional.

1446,1,"Signs of Major Depression Subtypes: Seasonal Onset
 
 It is a frequent misunderstanding that winter is the only season that can generate mood pathology.
 
 Anyone who has endured a long, cold winter has probably encountered a touch of the “winter blues.” This is a fairly normal experience whereby we might become lethargic, carb-craving and a little moody. It tends not to be what psychology professionals term “pervasive,” meaning it doesn’t significantly affect our ability to function. It is also important to note that the popular term “Seasonal Affective Disorder” is not an official diagnosis. This is more of a pop cultural term for seasonally-occurring depression, though sometimes adopted by professionals, too.
 
 Have no doubt, however! Seasonal mood changes are indeed specifiers within MDD and Bipolar spectrum illnesses, e.g., MDD with Seasonal Onset. Note that the specifier is with Seasonal Onset, not specifically winter onset. Interestingly, there is a subset of people with Seasonal Onset who become depressed in the brighter months. Individuals with Bipolar Disorders can also become hy/manic with the seasons. Today we focus on Major Depression with Seasonal Onset.
 
 The most common manifestation of Seasonal Onset is indeed MDD correlated with shortening days. This presentation is up to four times more prevalent in females and increases the further people live from the equator (Melrose, 2015). A popular theory is that it stems from lack of vitamin D, which sunlight naturally provides, and is well-known to be correlated with healthy moods. It seems that a big role of vitamin D is regulating serotonin transporters, particularly one called “sert.” People prone to Seasonal Onset moods seem prone to vitamin D sensitivities, most likely a genetic nuance (Stewart et al., 2014). Patients who have a pattern of developing an MDD episode as the days shorten seem to have an overabundance of sert (Ruhe et al., 2011; McMahon, 2016). Thought of another way, there is not enough vitamin D to act as a bouncer, allowing in only the right percentage of sert to the party. With too much sert on the scene, serotonin is then just being ushered through, not being allowed to have much of an effect on mood regulation. It is no secret that minimal serotonin saturation is highly correlated with depression.
 
 Conversely, it stands to reasons that the rare individuals who develop MDD in correlation to increasing sunlight may have too much sert regulation. Their bouncer is stingy and won’t admit enough to the party. The brain is again not being saturated with serotonin, but now it is because there aren’t enough escorts to deliver all that is needed. In exceptionally rare cases, MDD episodes develop during both seasonal shifts.
 
 The Presentation:
 
 Of note, Seasonal Onset MDD seems correlated to an Atypical Features presentation (Harvard, 2014). What is most noteworthy, though, is when it makes its appearance. First, however, it is important to realize that the seasonal shifts aren’t the only time patients with Seasonal Onset may get depressed; they could have a general ebbing and flowing of episodes. However, like clockwork, each year as the sunlight changes, they indeed settle into a depressive episode..
 
 powered by Rubicon Project
 
 Diagnostic criteria notes that the seasonal pattern must be established as at least two consecutive instances of seasonal onset with full remission as the season changes. There is no seasonal demarcation indicating what’s too little or too much sunlight, meaning it doesn’t simply happen at the extremes, closest to solstices. Autumn’s case helps illustrate:
 
 Autumn, a 30-year-old professional, met with Dr. H after noticing a significant downward spiral as the fall progressed. She reported that, for several years she felt “blue” off and on in the winter, but if she took occasional trips down South to see her parents, and kept busy, she muddled through it and was good until the next winter. This time, the “blue” feeling started in September, and she slowly found herself overeating and fatigued on top of the blueness, which was quickly turning to gray as she headed into November. “As the day wears on at work I feel a brain fog and all I want to do is get home after work and hunker down to a movie, but I usually fall asleep halfway though,” she described. “The other day at work I was moving all slow, and my colleague told me I didn’t look good. If other people are seeing it, I figured I better call someone!” Autmn finished.
 
 Autumn’s experience is not unusual. If we ask Seasonal Onset patients to think about when first symptoms bubbled up, we may see the Seasonal Onset was a months-long, insidious process until they met MDD criteria. Depending on the person’s sensitivity, their mood could begin changing in the late summer as days are noticeably shortening. I’ve met others who don’t get depressed until we only have 10 hours or less of sunlight. Untreated symptoms may remit as soon as days begin lengthening, or take well into spring.

 Treatment Implications:
 
 I’ve told patients with Seasonal Onset, that in a way, it’s the best kind of MDD to get, because you know what to expect and can prepare for it. This is especially true if it is the only time they experience depression. Patients who struggle with depression throughout the year should be doing much of what follows already, but we may need to help them increase the activity if they are prone to Seasonal Onset. In therapy, we can reflect on the impending seasonal pattern, and help them assemble their survival kits:
 
 Many choose to discontinue their antidepressant after the seasonal depression ends. If so, arranging a visit with their psychiatrist at least a month prior to the normal onset of depression symptoms is essential. This will allow the medication time to take effect ahead of the curve.
 
 Vitamin D lamps have been met with some success by many. Encourage patients to discuss this with their psychiatrist.
 
 It is no secret that exercise has a big effect on mood. If they aren’t exercisers in general, develop a physical activity plan (after consultation with their physician, of course). If they already do exercise, perhaps increasing the number of days going to the gym, or getting a gym partner to keep them motivated will be necessary.
 
 Winter depression is correlated with increased appetite and especially carb cravings, which can add weight and further moodiness from sugar spikes and crashes. Review the importance of the effect of diet on mood, and encourage a visit with a nutritionist to help patients maximize a diet conducive to bettering mood. Diets high in Vitamins E and D, folate, and lean protein are well-researched as “medical foods” for fighting depression, especially in conjunction with antidepressant medications.
 
 Finding increased structure at a time of year that even non-depressed people tend to hibernate. This could be engaging in volunteer work, making it more of a point to engage in hobbies, or arranging regular social outings. Clients have found it helpful, for example, to be held to having coffee each day after work with a different family member or friend, and lunch every Sunday with their siblings at a different restaurant.
 
 All along, the good therapist will be a supportive task master for the above, along with helping their patients manage the inherent day-to-day struggles. This may be cognitive-behavioral approaches to improving motivation, managing relationships that could become wrinkled due to their depressed state (especially sexual, given libido can decline with depression and be further reduced by some antidepressants), and managing the low self-esteem and dark thoughts that ebb and flow with depressed states.
 
 Remember, the needs of each patient are different, so it’s important to review progress and what they feel they require. Not everyone needs weekly therapy during seasonal depression. Thankfully, many do well with medication, diet and exercise and only require a seasonal check-in to prepare.

 Next steps
 
 Therapy, medications, brain stimulation, and self-help strategies are just some of the many approaches to depression treatment.
 
 There’s a wide variety of treatment options available for depression, but it can take some trial and error to find one — or a combo — that works for you.
 
 While the cause of depression isn’t entirely known, it’s believed to be a blend of biological, social, and psychological factors. Treatment that focuses on only one of these factors may not be as helpful as an approach that addresses multiple aspects.
 
 In fact, a combo of therapy and medication may lead to some of the best results.
 
 Finding the right treatments can be tricky, though. Just because something works for some people, doesn’t mean it’ll work for you.
 
 As you or a loved one seeks depression treatment, keep in mind that the first treatment isn’t always the right one. It’s normal for it to take some time to find the best treatment options.
 
 Depression treatment is often a journey rather than a sprint. With patience and self-compassion, you can find methods that help you keep depression symptoms at bay.
 
 Psychotherapy for depression
 
 Many types of therapy can help you manage depression and its symptoms.
 
 While some types have undergone more rigorous research than others, approaches that help you identify thoughts, behaviors, and beliefs that add to depression are often considered the most effective.
 
 Some helpful forms of therapy for depression include:
 
 cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
 
 interpersonal therapy (IPT)
 
 behavioral activation therapy (BA)
 
 acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
 
 problem-solving therapy (PST)
 
 short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)
 
 couples or family therapy
 
 Check out some more details on these therapy types below:
 
 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
 
 CBT is one of the most popular and commonly used therapies for depression. Hundreds of studies have verified its safety and effectiveness.
 
 In CBT, the focus is on changing thoughts and behaviors that can worsen or encourage depression. These thoughts often contribute to:
 
 feelings of worthlessness
 
 frustration with yourself
 
 hopelessness
 
 feelings of being “stuck” or “in a rut”
 
 A therapist will usually work with you one-on-one to help you learn to replace these thoughts with more realistic thoughts that support your well-being and goals.
 
 You don’t usually focus on your past in CBT. Instead, you’ll focus on changing your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors right now.
 
 Interpersonal therapy (IPT)
 
 In IPT, you address your social relationships and how to improve them.
 
 Stable social support is often considered key to overall well-being. When relationships falter, it can negatively impact the people in them.
 
 The aim of IPT is to improve a person’s relationship skills, such as:
 
 communicating effectively
 
 expressing emotions clearly
 
 being assertive in personal and professional situations
 
 Like CBT, IPT usually takes place with a therapist one-on-one but also can be done in a group setting.
 
 Behavioral activation therapy (BA)
 
 BA therapy can help people change behaviors, which in turn may help change their moods.
 
 Research has found BA to be just as effective as cognitive therapy in managing depression.
 
 In BA, you might learn:
 
 to identify when you start to feel depressed
 
 how to engage in activities that line up with your beliefs and values
 
 replace behaviors that contribute to depression with ones that don’t
 
 A BA therapist can help you identify your goals and achieve them. Recent researchTrusted Source also suggests that BA for depression may be effective in a group setting.
 
 Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
 
 In ACT, acceptance and mindfulness are key. One of the main goals of ACT is to help people live according to their values while coping with uncomfortable thoughts and feelings.
 
 If you live with depression, ACT may help you:
 
 focus on the present
 
 observe and accept uncomfortable thoughts and feelings
 
 identify what’s most meaningful and important to you
 
 act on your values
 
 One study found that ACT’s emphasis on value-based action helped people reduce symptoms of depression.
 
 Problem-solving therapy (PST)
 
 In some cases, depression can cause people to view problems as threats or believe they’re incapable of solving the problem.
 
 In PST, your therapist may help you:
 
 define the problem
 
 brainstorm alternative realistic solutions
 
 select a helpful solution
 
 put that solution in place and evaluate it
 
 ResearchTrusted Source suggests PST can help people with depression learn to cope with stressful problems in their daily lives.
 
 Short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)
 
 STPP focuses on interpersonal relationships and unconscious thoughts and feelings.
 
 The primary goal of STPP is to reduce your depression symptoms. The secondary goal is to decrease your vulnerability to depression and increase your resilience.
 
 ResearchTrusted Source is currently underway to see how STPP could help people with different types of depression.
 
 Family or couples therapy
 
 Family or couples therapy can help if depression is impacting your family dynamic or the health of your relationships.
 
 These therapies tend to focus on:
 
 interpersonal relationships of family members
 
 clear and straightforward communication
 
 the roles of family members in managing your depression
 
 education about depression and mental health
 
 Therapy is an active collaboration between you and your therapist (and sometimes loved ones).
 
 Whatever therapy you choose, taking a proactive approach can help. This means keeping up with assignments between sessions and letting your therapist know if you have any concerns.
 
 Medications for depression
 
 Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed medications for depression.
 
 Most antidepressants prescribed today are both safe and effective when taken according to your healthcare professional’s directions.
 
 In the United States, antidepressants are often prescribed by family doctors or general practitioners. But many people find it most helpful to work with a psychiatrist or other mental health professional, as they may have extensive knowledge of medication types and side effects.
 
 Your doctor will recommend a medication based on factors such as:
 
 your past experiences with meds
 
 side effects you experienced with any other medications
 
 co-occurring medical or mental health conditions
 
 any other meds you’re taking
 
 your personal preference
 
 the medication’s short and long-term side effects
 
 the toxicity of overdose
 
 any history your relatives have had with the medication
 
 financial constraints
 
 It can take up to 6 to 8 weeks to start getting results with most antidepressants, so you may need to give it some time. If you experience side effects, many will go away before this point.
 
 Keep in mind that you might not feel better with the first medication you try — sometimes you might need to try a few different types before finding the meds that work for you.
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
 
 SSRIs are some of the most prescribed antidepressants for depression.
 
 SSRIs increase the amount of serotonin in the brain. Researchers aren’t exactly sure why an increase in serotonin helps relieve depression, but decades’ worth of studiesTrusted Source suggest these medications help improve mood.
 
 Some of the most common SSRIs are:
 
 fluoxetine (Prozac)
 
 paroxetine (Paxil)
 
 sertraline (Zoloft)
 
 fluvoxamine (Luvox)
 
 citalopram (Celexa)
 
 While SSRIs are usually well-tolerated, most people experience some side effects while taking them. These might include:
 
 nausea
 
 diarrhea
 
 agitation
 
 insomnia
 
 headache
 
 lowered sex drive
 
 weight gain
 
 For most people, these initial side effects dissipate within 3 to 4 weeks. Some side effects, such as tremors cause by serotonin syndrome or weight gain, are long-term side effects of taking SSRIs.
 
 Serotonin syndrome
 
 Serotonin syndrome occurs when you have too much serotonin in your body. This can cause mild to severe side effects and can be fatal if you don’t receive quick treatment.
 
 If you take an antidepressant and notice symptoms like tremors, rapid heartbeat, or hallucinations, it’s important to let your doctor know right away.
 
 Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
 
 SNRIs work by boosting the levels of two neurotransmitters — serotonin and norepinephrine — in your brain. These chemicals play an essential role in your mood.
 
 Some commonly prescribed SNRIs include:
 
 venlafaxine (Effexor)
 
 duloxetine (Cymbalta)
 
 SNRIs can cause many of the same side effects as SSRIs.
 
 They can also cause:
 
 anxiety
 
 constipation
 
 lack of energy
 
 If an SSRI isn’t working for you, your doctor might prescribe an SNRI. If you also have anxiety, an SNRI may be a better option since some are used to treat anxiety disorders.
 
 Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
 
 TCAs are older antidepressants, and while they’re not prescribed as often as SSRIs and SNRIs, they still help some people manage depression.
 
 Some common TCAs include:
 
 doxepin (Adapin)
 
 clomipramine (Anafranil)
 
 amitriptyline (Elavil)
 
 imipramine (Tofranil)
 
 Some common side effects of TCAs include:
 
 drowsiness
 
 weight gain
 
 constipation
 
 dizziness
 
 heart problems
 
 blurred vision
 
 confusion
 
 Since TCAs generally cause more side effects than newer antidepressants, they’re usually considered an option only if newer antidepressants don’t work for you.
 
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
 
 MAOIs aren’t prescribed as frequently as other types of antidepressants anymore. This is because they’ve been known to cause severe side effects and have unwanted interactions with many foods and other drugs.
 
 A few examples of MAOIs include:
 
 tranylcypromine (Parnate)
 
 phenelzine (Nardil)
 
 isocarboxazid (Marplan)
 
 Side effects of MAOIs include:
 
 dry mouth
 
 nausea
 
 diarrhea
 
 constipation
 
 insomnia
 
 drowsiness
 
 dizziness
 
 MAOIs can interact with other drugs and antidepressants, some supplements and herbs, and certain foods (especially those that contain high levels of tyramine).
 
 Your doctor may only prescribe an MAOI if other types of medications aren’t working for you.
 
 Atypical antidepressants
 
 Atypical antidepressants don’t fall into any of the other antidepressant classes. They’re often prescribed when a person hasn’t improved with a common SSRI.
 
 Examples of atypical antidepressants include:
 
 nefazodone (Serzone)
 
 trazodone (Desyrel)
 
 bupropion (Wellbutrin)
 
 Sometimes these meds are prescribed when others cause severe side effects, or in combination with other antidepressants.
 
 Mood stabilizers and antipsychotics
 
 Your doctor might also prescribe an atypical antipsychotic to boost the effectiveness of your antidepressant.
 
 The following atypical antipsychotics are sometimes used to add to your treatment:
 
 aripiprazole (Abilify)
 
 quetiapine XR (Seroquel XR)
 
 olanzapine-fluoxetine (Symbyax)
 
 brexpiprazole (Rexulti)
 
 Lithium, a mood stabilizer commonly used to treat bipolar disorder, is also sometimes used to treat major depressive disorder.
 
 Ketamine
 
 Ketamine is one of the newest treatments for severe forms of depression.
 
 In 2019, the FDA approved a prescription nasal spray called esketamine (Spravato). It’s a fast-acting drug derived from ketamine and can be taken along with an antidepressant to treat severe depression.
 
 Spravato must be taken at a doctor’s office or clinic. Because Spravato can have severe side effects, including sedation and dissociation, people are monitored by their doctor for 2 hours after taking the med.
 
 While apparently effective for many people who try it, the long-term effects of ketamine haven’t been studied yet. Since it’s so new, it may also be harder to obtain and is only recommended for treatment-resistant depression.
 
 Brain stimulation therapy for depression
 
 Brain stimulation therapies help treat depression with electricity acting on the brain.
 
 While therapy and meds are used much more often than brain stimulation therapies, they may be effective for reducing depression in some people.
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
 
 ECT is considered an effective treatment option for severe, chronic, or treatment-resistant depression.
 
 ECT isn’t typically an initial treatment for depression, though. This is because you’re placed under general anesthesia, may need to take time off work or school, and it can come with side effects like memory loss.
 
 Still, current researchTrusted Source supports its effectiveness for treating depression. But questions regarding memory loss and ECT have yet to be fully answered.
 
 Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
 
 rTMS is a newer type of brain stimulation that may be an alternative to and more accessible than ECT.
 
 In rTMS, a technician places an electromagnet on the scalp that generates magnetic field pulses roughly to the strength of an MRI scan. These pulses pass readily through the skull and may stimulate the cerebral cortex.
 
 Potential benefits of rTMS that have been observed include:
 
 no systemic side effects such as: weight gain, sexual dysfunction, sedation, nausea, or dry mouth
 
 no adverse effects on concentration or memory
 
 reduced risk of device-drug interactions
 
 Seizures are also much less likely to occur as a side effect compared to other brain therapies.
 
 The most common adverse event related to treatment was mild to moderate scalp pain or discomfort during treatments, which lessened after the first week of treatment.
 
 Hospitalization for depression
 
 In some cases, hospitalization may be the best way to keep someone safe if their depression is severe. But hospitalization is typically only necessary if someone poses a danger to themselves or others.
 
 Hospitalization for depression requires a lot of care. It’s usually best when someone can check themselves into a hospital. This way, they’re able to give their full consent to treatment.
 
 Involuntary hospitalization to a psychiatric hospital is fairly rare, and there are legal requirements involved. In order for someone to be placed in hospitalization against their will, it typically has to be very clear that it’s the best way to help that person.
 
 Hospitalization is usually relatively short — often until you’re stabilized and have a treatment plan. In some cases, you may only need a partial hospitalization plan.
 
 Are you or a loved one in crisis?
 
 If you believe you or a loved one is in crisis and may need hospitalization, there are many options available for immediate help:
 
 Call a suicide prevention hotline. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline in the U.S. at 800-273-8255 or find a helpline through Befrienders Worldwide.
 
 Text “HOME” to the Crisis Text Line at 741741.
 
 Call or visit a local emergency room or psychiatric care center to speak with a mental health professional.
 
 Self-help strategies
 
 A variety of self-help strategies, including home remedies and lifestyle changes, can empower you with tools to manage your depression.
 
 Home remedies
 
 It’s not uncommon to want to try home remedies — such as supplements and teas — either before starting prescription meds or in combination with your current treatment.
 
 While some of these remedies can be helpful, before you start anything, reach out to a healthcare professional. Some remedies interact with antidepressants or other meds, or may only work for mild symptoms.
 
 Like anything else, home remedies may or may not work for you, but most are generally safe to try.
 
 St. John’s wort
 
 St. John’s wort is a popular herbal remedy for depression — though it does come with its fair share of interactions.
 
 Research suggests that St. John’s wort can help people with mild and moderate depression. A 2017 meta-analysisTrusted Source found it comparable in safety and effectiveness to SSRIs.
 
 However, St. John’s wort interacts (sometimes dangerously) with several medications:
 
 antidepressants
 
 birth control pills
 
 warfarin, a blood thinner
 
 other medications for the heart, HIV, or cancer
 
 It may also make you more sensitive to sunlight, and cause interactions with certain foods.
 
 Saffron
 
 Recent research has found some evidence that saffron may be effective in treating mild to moderate depression.
 
 According to this studyTrusted Source, saffron was better than the placebo at reducing the severity of depression symptoms.
 
 Green and black tea
 
 Tea contains compounds — L-theanine and catechins, to name a couple — that may have antidepressant effects.
 
 ResearchTrusted Source suggests that regularly drinking a cup of green or black tea could reduce some depression symptoms.
 
 Omega-3 fatty acids
 
 Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats found in many fish, nuts, and seeds. ResearchTrusted Source suggests that omega-3s may help reduce symptoms of depression.
 
 To get more omega-3s in your diet, you can add foods rich in them like salmon, mackerel, and chia seeds. You might also take a supplement if you’re not getting enough from diet alone.
 
 Vitamin D
 
 Most people are lacking in vitamin D, and some researchTrusted Source suggests that vitamin D deficiency is connected to depression.
 
 While more research is needed to understand the link between depression and vitamin D, most doctors will support supplementing with vitamin D to help with mood and depression symptoms.
 
 Probiotics
 
 Probiotics often bring to mind gut health — but depression doesn’t just affect your thoughts. Some researchTrusted Source suggests that probiotics could help people reduce depression by improving gut health.
 
 A 2019 reviewTrusted Source also found that while prebiotics didn’t have any noticeable effect on depression, probiotics yielded promising results.
 
 Lifestyle changes
 
 In many cases, making lifestyle changes can help you reduce and manage depression symptoms. ResearchTrusted Source supports the idea that diet and exercise, for example, can impact the severity of your symptoms.
 
 While the ways you might choose to adjust your lifestyle are endless, below are a few tried-and-true strategies that have been used to help with depression.
 
 Support groups
 
 For some people, one of the most effective strategies is to join a depression-focused support group.
 
 You can find a variety of depression support groups online. These groups may give you the opportunity to:
 
 socialize
 
 develop healthy relationships
 
 talk with people who have similar experiences and feelings
 
 Mental Health America has a popular support group for people with depression, and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance has an online support group for people with depression and bipolar disorder.
 
 Workbooks
 
 Another excellent strategy is to read self-help books or workbooks on overcoming depression. Some examples include:
 
 “The Feeling Good Handbook”
 
 “Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Depression: A Step-by-Step Program”
 
 “Mind Over Mood: Change How You Feel By Changing the Way You Think”
 
 Some books emphasize a cognitive behavioral approach, which is similar to those used in many types of therapy. So these books can be helpful whether or not you’re currently working with a therapist (or in between sessions if you can’t access one frequently).
 
 Exercise
 
 Engaging in physical activity and getting outdoors can be incredibly helpful in improving mood. Both sunlight and exercise have been well-established to boost mood and reduce depression symptoms.
 
 If you’re currently not experiencing much sunshine where you live, consider trying a light therapy box. This can especially help if you experience seasonal symptoms of depression, like in seasonal affective disorder.
 
 While saying that exercise can help with depression is one thing, actually doing it is another.
 
 Depression often causes fatigue or lack of motivation — so be gentle with yourself. You don’t need to join a gym or start a daily workout program. Any movement and time spent outdoors can be a step in the right direction.
 
 Diet
 
 One way or the other, food affects mood. ResearchTrusted Source looking into the link between diet quality and depression found that higher quality diets were connected to a lower risk of depression.
 
 In particular, people who ate higher amounts of fish (omega-3s!) and veggies were less likely to have depressive symptoms.
 
 So if you want to give your mood a boost, try adding some more foods that support well-being into your diet.
 
 Next steps
 
 If there’s one thing you can take away, let it be this: You’ve got endless options when it comes to managing your depression.
 
 While it can feel overwhelming to some people, the more options means better opportunities to find the right treatments that work for you.
 
 Depression treatment is often determined by how severe your symptoms are. One question you might ask yourself is, “How much does depression affect my everyday life?”
 
 If your depression is severe — you find it hard to do much at all — talking with a doctor is a good first step. In many cases, a doctor will refer you to a mental health specialist who can connect you with treatments, like therapy or medication, to manage your symptoms.
 
 If you consider your depression mild, it might help to start by implementing some lifestyle changes or home remedies to see if they work for you. Keep in mind that if you need it, more help is available.

 Next steps
 
 Therapy, medications, brain stimulation, and self-help strategies are just some of the many approaches to depression treatment.
 
 There’s a wide variety of treatment options available for depression, but it can take some trial and error to find one — or a combo — that works for you.
 
 While the cause of depression isn’t entirely known, it’s believed to be a blend of biological, social, and psychological factors. Treatment that focuses on only one of these factors may not be as helpful as an approach that addresses multiple aspects.
 
 In fact, a combo of therapy and medication may lead to some of the best results.
 
 Finding the right treatments can be tricky, though. Just because something works for some people, doesn’t mean it’ll work for you.
 
 As you or a loved one seeks depression treatment, keep in mind that the first treatment isn’t always the right one. It’s normal for it to take some time to find the best treatment options.
 
 Depression treatment is often a journey rather than a sprint. With patience and self-compassion, you can find methods that help you keep depression symptoms at bay.
 
 Psychotherapy for depression
 
 Many types of therapy can help you manage depression and its symptoms.
 
 While some types have undergone more rigorous research than others, approaches that help you identify thoughts, behaviors, and beliefs that add to depression are often considered the most effective.
 
 Some helpful forms of therapy for depression include:
 
 cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
 
 interpersonal therapy (IPT)
 
 behavioral activation therapy (BA)
 
 acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
 
 problem-solving therapy (PST)
 
 short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)
 
 couples or family therapy
 
 Check out some more details on these therapy types below:
 
 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
 
 CBT is one of the most popular and commonly used therapies for depression. Hundreds of studies have verified its safety and effectiveness.
 
 In CBT, the focus is on changing thoughts and behaviors that can worsen or encourage depression. These thoughts often contribute to:
 
 feelings of worthlessness
 
 frustration with yourself
 
 hopelessness
 
 feelings of being “stuck” or “in a rut”
 
 A therapist will usually work with you one-on-one to help you learn to replace these thoughts with more realistic thoughts that support your well-being and goals.
 
 You don’t usually focus on your past in CBT. Instead, you’ll focus on changing your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors right now.
 
 Interpersonal therapy (IPT)
 
 In IPT, you address your social relationships and how to improve them.
 
 Stable social support is often considered key to overall well-being. When relationships falter, it can negatively impact the people in them.
 
 The aim of IPT is to improve a person’s relationship skills, such as:
 
 communicating effectively
 
 expressing emotions clearly
 
 being assertive in personal and professional situations
 
 Like CBT, IPT usually takes place with a therapist one-on-one but also can be done in a group setting.
 
 Behavioral activation therapy (BA)
 
 BA therapy can help people change behaviors, which in turn may help change their moods.
 
 Research has found BA to be just as effective as cognitive therapy in managing depression.
 
 In BA, you might learn:
 
 to identify when you start to feel depressed
 
 how to engage in activities that line up with your beliefs and values
 
 replace behaviors that contribute to depression with ones that don’t
 
 A BA therapist can help you identify your goals and achieve them. Recent researchTrusted Source also suggests that BA for depression may be effective in a group setting.
 
 Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
 
 In ACT, acceptance and mindfulness are key. One of the main goals of ACT is to help people live according to their values while coping with uncomfortable thoughts and feelings.
 
 If you live with depression, ACT may help you:
 
 focus on the present
 
 observe and accept uncomfortable thoughts and feelings
 
 identify what’s most meaningful and important to you
 
 act on your values
 
 One study found that ACT’s emphasis on value-based action helped people reduce symptoms of depression.
 
 Problem-solving therapy (PST)
 
 In some cases, depression can cause people to view problems as threats or believe they’re incapable of solving the problem.
 
 In PST, your therapist may help you:
 
 define the problem
 
 brainstorm alternative realistic solutions
 
 select a helpful solution
 
 put that solution in place and evaluate it
 
 ResearchTrusted Source suggests PST can help people with depression learn to cope with stressful problems in their daily lives.
 
 Short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)
 
 STPP focuses on interpersonal relationships and unconscious thoughts and feelings.
 
 The primary goal of STPP is to reduce your depression symptoms. The secondary goal is to decrease your vulnerability to depression and increase your resilience.
 
 ResearchTrusted Source is currently underway to see how STPP could help people with different types of depression.
 
 Family or couples therapy
 
 Family or couples therapy can help if depression is impacting your family dynamic or the health of your relationships.
 
 These therapies tend to focus on:
 
 interpersonal relationships of family members
 
 clear and straightforward communication
 
 the roles of family members in managing your depression

 Like anything else, home remedies may or may not work for you, but most are generally safe to try.
 
 St. John’s wort
 
 St. John’s wort is a popular herbal remedy for depression — though it does come with its fair share of interactions.
 
 Research suggests that St. John’s wort can help people with mild and moderate depression. A 2017 meta-analysisTrusted Source found it comparable in safety and effectiveness to SSRIs.
 
 However, St. John’s wort interacts (sometimes dangerously) with several medications:
 
 antidepressants
 
 birth control pills
 
 warfarin, a blood thinner
 
 other medications for the heart, HIV, or cancer
 
 It may also make you more sensitive to sunlight, and cause interactions with certain foods.
 
 Saffron
 
 Recent research has found some evidence that saffron may be effective in treating mild to moderate depression.
 
 According to this studyTrusted Source, saffron was better than the placebo at reducing the severity of depression symptoms.
 
 Green and black tea
 
 Tea contains compounds — L-theanine and catechins, to name a couple — that may have antidepressant effects.
 
 ResearchTrusted Source suggests that regularly drinking a cup of green or black tea could reduce some depression symptoms.
 
 Omega-3 fatty acids
 
 Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats found in many fish, nuts, and seeds. ResearchTrusted Source suggests that omega-3s may help reduce symptoms of depression.
 
 To get more omega-3s in your diet, you can add foods rich in them like salmon, mackerel, and chia seeds. You might also take a supplement if you’re not getting enough from diet alone.
 
 Vitamin D
 
 Most people are lacking in vitamin D, and some researchTrusted Source suggests that vitamin D deficiency is connected to depression.
 
 While more research is needed to understand the link between depression and vitamin D, most doctors will support supplementing with vitamin D to help with mood and depression symptoms.
 
 Probiotics
 
 Probiotics often bring to mind gut health — but depression doesn’t just affect your thoughts. Some researchTrusted Source suggests that probiotics could help people reduce depression by improving gut health.
 
 A 2019 reviewTrusted Source also found that while prebiotics didn’t have any noticeable effect on depression, probiotics yielded promising results.
 
 Lifestyle changes
 
 In many cases, making lifestyle changes can help you reduce and manage depression symptoms. ResearchTrusted Source supports the idea that diet and exercise, for example, can impact the severity of your symptoms.
 
 While the ways you might choose to adjust your lifestyle are endless, below are a few tried-and-true strategies that have been used to help with depression.
 
 Support groups
 
 For some people, one of the most effective strategies is to join a depression-focused support group.
 
 You can find a variety of depression support groups online. These groups may give you the opportunity to:
 
 socialize
 
 develop healthy relationships
 
 talk with people who have similar experiences and feelings
 
 Mental Health America has a popular support group for people with depression, and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance has an online support group for people with depression and bipolar disorder.
 
 Workbooks
 
 Another excellent strategy is to read self-help books or workbooks on overcoming depression. Some examples include:
 
 “The Feeling Good Handbook”
 
 “Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Depression: A Step-by-Step Program”
 
 “Mind Over Mood: Change How You Feel By Changing the Way You Think”
 
 Some books emphasize a cognitive behavioral approach, which is similar to those used in many types of therapy. So these books can be helpful whether or not you’re currently working with a therapist (or in between sessions if you can’t access one frequently).
 
 Exercise
 
 Engaging in physical activity and getting outdoors can be incredibly helpful in improving mood. Both sunlight and exercise have been well-established to boost mood and reduce depression symptoms.
 
 If you’re currently not experiencing much sunshine where you live, consider trying a light therapy box. This can especially help if you experience seasonal symptoms of depression, like in seasonal affective disorder.
 
 While saying that exercise can help with depression is one thing, actually doing it is another.
 
 Depression often causes fatigue or lack of motivation — so be gentle with yourself. You don’t need to join a gym or start a daily workout program. Any movement and time spent outdoors can be a step in the right direction.
 
 Diet
 
 One way or the other, food affects mood. ResearchTrusted Source looking into the link between diet quality and depression found that higher quality diets were connected to a lower risk of depression.
 
 In particular, people who ate higher amounts of fish (omega-3s!) and veggies were less likely to have depressive symptoms.
 
 So if you want to give your mood a boost, try adding some more foods that support well-being into your diet.
 
 Next steps
 
 If there’s one thing you can take away, let it be this: You’ve got endless options when it comes to managing your depression.
 
 While it can feel overwhelming to some people, the more options means better opportunities to find the right treatments that work for you.
 
 Depression treatment is often determined by how severe your symptoms are. One question you might ask yourself is, “How much does depression affect my everyday life?”
 
 If your depression is severe — you find it hard to do much at all — talking with a doctor is a good first step. In many cases, a doctor will refer you to a mental health specialist who can connect you with treatments, like therapy or medication, to manage your symptoms.
 
 If you consider your depression mild, it might help to start by implementing some lifestyle changes or home remedies to see if they work for you. Keep in mind that if you need it, more help is available.

 biochemical factors (brain chemistry)
 
 illness
 
 personality style
 
 ageing
 
 long-term pressures such as abusive relationships, bullying and work stress

 Knowing about the causes and risk factors for depression can help you understand why depression occurs and how to deal with it. It’s important to emphasise that depression is not a sign of personal weakness, failure, or ‘all in the mind’.
 
 Each of us are unique and will respond differently when exposed to environmental, social or psychological triggers.

 Causes of depression in pregnancy and postnatally
 
 There is no simple or single explanation for why some people develop depression during pregnancy and after the birth of a child. We all respond and cope differently with the stresses associated with labour, childbirth and adjusting to living with a new baby. Short episodes of mood swings often resolve without treatment.
 
 The onset of depression appears to be linked to stress, but stress itself is not the primary risk factor, just the trigger.
 
 Factors associated with an increased risk of postnatal depression include physical illness, previous history of mental illness, adverse childhood experiences with parents, stress, insufficient social supports, pregnancy loss, an unsettled baby, and personality type.",,

 There are a range of effective treatments, that can help you recover/manage. Start by talking to your GP.
 
 Important things to know about getting treatment for depression:
 
 Different types of depression respond to different kinds of treatments. You need a thorough check from a health professional before treatment is prescribed.
 
 Depression can sometimes go away by itself. But left untreated, it may last for many months or get significantly worse. Always seek help early, so you can recover sooner.
 
 Depending on the nature of your depression, self-help and alternative therapies can be helpful. They can be used alone or combined with physical and psychological treatments.
 
 Most people who have had depression have been able to seek help and live active, fulfilling lives.
 
 There are three broad categories of treatment for depression:
 
 psychological
 
 physical
 
 self-help and alternative therapies.
 
 Often, a combination of treatments works best. Different types of depression require different treatments. As we are all individuals with different contributing factors, we all respond differently to treatment.

 A stepped care approach to treating major depressive disorder
 
 Doctors from the Black Dog Institute have recently developed a ‘stepped care approach’ to treating patients with major depressive disorder. Essentially, it involves managing patients according to how severe their depression is when they first see their doctor.
 
 Care is ‘stepped up’ if the initial treatment is not providing a sufficient response.
 
 Health professionals and interested people can download, ‘Adult depression: A step-by-step approach guide to treatment’.
 
 Overview of the ‘stepped care approach’ developed by doctors and researchers at the Black Dog Institute. 
 
 Step 1: Mild depression
 
 Step 2: Moderate depression
 
 Step 3: Severe depression
 
 Step 4: Severe depression with marked functional impairment

 Psychological treatments for depression
 
 Psychological treatments are sometimes called ‘talking therapies’. They can help us change habits in the way we think, and help us cope better with life’s challenges. Some are based on one-on-one interactions, others are group-based.
 
 Psychological treatments provide either an alternative to medication, or work alongside medication. They are also useful in helping us stay well once we’ve recovered from depression.
 
 A thorough assessment is needed to decide on the best combination of treatments for you.
 
 There are a wide range of psychological treatments for depression:
 
 cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)
 
 e-mental health programs (online therapies)
 
 interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)
 
 mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
 
 positive psychology

It can be good to know that there are things you can do for yourself to feel better. Some of these are listed below.
 
 More biological and severe types of depression are unlikely to respond to self-help and alternative therapies alone. However, they are valuable adjuncts to physical treatments.

 Pregnancy and the postnatal period
 
 The symptoms of depression or anxiety that occur in childbearing women can be similar to those that occur at other times of life.
 
 However, choices for treatment may differ during pregnancy or when a woman is breastfeeding.
 
 Treatment options include counselling, psychological therapies and medications. 
 
 It’s important to treat depression and anxiety as early as possible because these conditions not only cause distress for the mother, but can also influence her ability to cope with her baby, and affect their developing relationship.
 
 Partners and young children can also feel stressed when a parent is anxious or depressed.
 
 Types of treatment will vary with the nature and severity of the symptoms, and the type of depression.

 Teen depression: Information for health professionals
 
 The following information is intended for health professionals and relates to the treatment of unipolar depression in adolescents.
 
 Treating depression in adolescents requires a multi-modal approach that takes into account the adolescent’s context in terms of their age, their family circumstances, as well as their social and educational settings.
 
 Antidepressant drugs are considered along with other management strategies, but are only indicated as first-line treatment in adolescents with a melancholic depression.
 
 Overview
 
 Prevalence of depression in adolescents worldwide is 1–2% annually.
 
 Recurrence rates are high: 50–70% within five years.
 
 Onset of depression in early adolescence has a poorer prognosis.
 
 Despite adequate drug treatment, 20% of adolescents with depression don’t improve in the short term, highlighting the need for more comprehensive management planning, combining psychological and pharmacological treatment.
 
 General approach to management
 
 The use of antidepressants",,
1468,0,"By learning the warning signs, anyone can help to prevent suicide by following this advice.
 
 It is important that we recognise the signs.
 
 When people are thinking about ending their life, there are sometimes signs you may notice. They may be feeling distraught and can’t see a way out of their problems.
 
 People show signs in different ways, so it is best to be aware of both verbal and non-verbal cues.
 
 Are you or someone near you in immediate danger?
 
 Call Emergency Services on 000; or
 
 Go to a hospital emergency department
 
 Are you having suicidal thoughts and need someone to talk to?
 
 Call Lifeline on 13 11 14
 
 Talk to someone like:
 
 a GP, counsellor, psychologist or psychiatrist
 
 family or friends
 
 a school, university or TAFE counsellor
 
 a teacher or coach
 
 a work colleague
 
 a church minister or religious leader
 
 If you’re worried that someone is thinking about taking their own life, it’s important to talk to them.
 
 People usually don’t want to end their life. They want the pain to stop.
 
 There is a sense of isolation and hopelessness if they don’t think they have the support to get through it.
 
 Talking to people can reduce stigma and encourage them to seek help, factors proven to lower risks of suicidal behaviours. (1)
 
 Don’t ignore threats of suicide
 
 Many people who take their own life give some kind of warning beforehand.  
 
 When people express suicidal thoughts, these need to be taken seriously. 
 
 Even if you’re not sure, it’s better to help straight away than to be unsure and not act at all. Talk to the person and get professional advice from others.
 
 Seeking help for suicidal thoughts
 
 If you are having suicidal thoughts, you need to stay safe and get help. These sources of help can offer support to get you through this.

 How you can help prevent suicide
 
 If you're worried about someone having suicidal thoughts you should ACT IMMEDIATELY by taking the following steps.
 
 Suicide & self-harm Helping others
 
 Behavioural changes
 
 If someone is acting out of the ordinary, this is no cause for alarm but a sign to pay attention to their behaviours.
 
 These signs might include:
 
 sleep changes (too much sleep or too little)
 
 withdrawing from family and friends
 
 loss of interest in things
 
 changes in eating
 
 irritability, being moody or easily upset
 
 self-harming (e.g. cutting)
 
 putting affairs in order, giving things away, saying goodbyes, writing suicide notes or goodbye letters
 
 risky behaviour (e.g. consuming excessive alcohol or other drug use)
 
 decreased academic or work performance
 
 mentioning or joking about suicide, death or dying
 
 How feelings are expressed
 
 Some people choose to talk about how they are feeling, however this does not apply to everyone.
 
 They might be feeling hopeless, depressed, angry and irritable, distressed, worthless, exhausted, like there’s no way out of their problems or no reason for living at all.
 
 They might say things which suggest that:
 
 they see themselves as a burden (2) – e.g. “You’d be better off without me.”
 
 they can’t see a way out of their situation – e.g. “I’ve had enough.” or “I’m over it.”
 
 they’re feeling a sense of hopelessness – e.g. “There’s nothing to live for.” or “There’s no point.”",,
1503,0,"Overview
 
 If you have a mood disorder, your general emotional state or mood is distorted or inconsistent with your circumstances and interferes with your ability to function. You may be extremely sad, empty or irritable (depressed), or you may have periods of depression alternating with being excessively happy (mania).
 
 Anxiety disorders can also affect your mood and often occur along with depression. Mood disorders may increase your risk of suicide.
 
 Some examples of mood disorders include:
 
 Major depressive disorder — prolonged and persistent periods of extreme sadness
 
 Bipolar disorder — also called manic depression or bipolar affective disorder, depression that includes alternating times of depression and mania
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) — a form of depression most often associated with fewer hours of daylight in the far northern and southern latitudes from late fall to early spring
 
 Cyclothymic disorder — a disorder that causes emotional ups and downs that are less extreme than bipolar disorder
 
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder — mood changes and irritability that occur during the premenstrual phase of a woman's cycle and go away with the onset of menses
 
 Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) — a long-term (chronic) form of depression
 
 Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder — a disorder of chronic, severe and persistent irritability in children that often includes frequent temper outbursts that are inconsistent with the child's developmental age
 
 Depression related to medical illness — a persistent depressed mood and a significant loss of pleasure in most or all activities that's directly related to the physical effects of another medical condition
 
 Depression induced by substance use or medication ― depression symptoms that develop during or soon after substance use or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication
 
 For most people, mood disorders can be successfully treated with medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).
 
 When to see a doctor
 
 If you're concerned that you may have a mood disorder, make an appointment to see your doctor or a mental health professional as soon as you can. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.
 
 Talk to a health care professional if you:
 
 Feel like your emotions are interfering with your work, relationships, social activities or other parts of your life
 
 Have trouble with drinking or drugs
 
 Have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — seek emergency treatment immediately
 
 Your mood disorder is unlikely to simply go away on its own, and it may get worse over time. Seek professional help before your mood disorder becomes severe — it may be easier to treat early on.

 Symptoms
 
 Suicide warning signs or suicidal thoughts include:
 
 Talking about suicide — for example, making statements such as ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I wish I were dead"" or ""I wish I hadn't been born""
 
 Getting the means to take your own life, such as buying a gun or stockpiling pills
 
 Withdrawing from social contact and wanting to be left alone
 
 Having mood swings, such as being emotionally high one day and deeply discouraged the next
 
 Being preoccupied with death, dying or violence
 
 Feeling trapped or hopeless about a situation
 
 Increasing use of alcohol or drugs
 
 Changing normal routine, including eating or sleeping patterns
 
 Doing risky or self-destructive things, such as using drugs or driving recklessly
 
 Giving away belongings or getting affairs in order when there's no other logical explanation for doing this
 
 Saying goodbye to people as if they won't be seen again
 
 Developing personality changes or being severely anxious or agitated, particularly when experiencing some of the warning signs listed above
 
 Warning signs aren't always obvious, and they may vary from person to person. Some people make their intentions clear, while others keep suicidal thoughts and feelings secret.
 
 When to see a doctor
 
 If you're feeling suicidal, but you aren't immediately thinking of hurting yourself:
 
 Reach out to a close friend or loved one — even though it may be hard to talk about your feelings
 
 Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone in your faith community
 
 Call a suicide hotline
 
 Make an appointment with your doctor, other health care provider or a mental health professional
 
 Suicidal thinking doesn't get better on its own — so get help.

 Causes
 
 Suicidal thoughts have many causes. Most often, suicidal thoughts are the result of feeling like you can't cope when you're faced with what seems to be an overwhelming life situation. If you don't have hope for the future, you may mistakenly think suicide is a solution. You may experience a sort of tunnel vision, where in the middle of a crisis you believe suicide is the only way out.
 
 There also may be a genetic link to suicide. People who complete suicide or who have suicidal thoughts or behavior are more likely to have a family history of suicide.
 
 Risk factors
 
 Although attempted suicide is more frequent for women, men are more likely than women to complete suicide because they typically use more-lethal methods, such as a firearm.
 
 You may be at risk of suicide if you:
 
 Attempted suicide before
 
 Feel hopeless, worthless, agitated, socially isolated or lonely
 
 Experience a stressful life event, such as the loss of a loved one, military service, a breakup, or financial or legal problems
 
 Have a substance abuse problem — alcohol and drug abuse can worsen thoughts of suicide and make you feel reckless or impulsive enough to act on your thoughts
 
 Have suicidal thoughts and have access to firearms in your home
 
 Have an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or bipolar disorder
 
 Have a family history of mental disorders, substance abuse, suicide, or violence, including physical or sexual abuse
 
 Have a medical condition that can be linked to depression and suicidal thinking, such as chronic disease, chronic pain or terminal illness
 
 Are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender with an unsupportive family or in a hostile environment
 
 Children and teenagers
 
 Suicide in children and teenagers can follow stressful life events. What a young person sees as serious and insurmountable may seem minor to an adult — such as problems in school or the loss of a friendship. In some cases, a child or teen may feel suicidal due to certain life circumstances that he or she may not want to talk about, such as:
 
 Having a psychiatric disorder, including depression
 
 Loss or conflict with close friends or family members
 
 History of physical or sexual abuse
 
 Problems with alcohol or drugs
 
 Physical or medical issues, for example, becoming pregnant or having a sexually transmitted infection
 
 Being the victim of bullying
 
 Being uncertain of sexual orientation
 
 Reading or hearing an account of suicide or knowing a peer who died by suicide
 
 If you have concerns about a friend or family member, asking about suicidal thoughts and intentions is the best way to identify risk.
 
 Murder and suicide
 
 In rare cases, people who are suicidal are at risk of killing others and then themselves. Known as a homicide-suicide or murder-suicide, some risk factors include:
 
 History of conflict with a spouse or romantic partner
 
 Current family legal or financial problems
 
 History of mental health problems, particularly depression
 
 Alcohol or drug abuse
 
 Having access to a firearm
 
 Starting antidepressants and increased suicide risk
 
 Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the Food and Drug Administration requires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings, the strictest warnings for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed.
 
 However, keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood.
 
 Teen suicide prevention
 
 Reach out — Preventing teen suicide
 
 Complications
 
 Suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide take an emotional toll. For instance, you may be so consumed by suicidal thoughts that you can't function in your daily life. And while many attempted suicides are impulsive acts during a moment of crisis, they can leave you with permanent serious or severe injuries, such as organ failure or brain damage.
 
 For those left behind after a suicide — people known as survivors of suicide — grief, anger, depression and guilt are common.
 
 Prevention
 
 To help keep yourself from feeling suicidal:
 
 Get the treatment you need. If you don't treat the underlying cause, your suicidal thoughts are likely to return. You may feel embarrassed to seek treatment for mental health problems, but getting the right treatment for depression, substance misuse or another underlying problem will make you feel better about life — and help keep you safe.
 
 Establish your support network. It may be hard to talk about suicidal feelings, and your friends and family may not fully understand why you feel the way you do. Reach out anyway, and make sure the people who care about you know what's going on and are there when you need them. You may also want to get help from your place of worship, support groups or other community resources. Feeling connected and supported can help reduce suicide risk.
 
 Remember, suicidal feelings are temporary. If you feel hopeless or that life's not worth living anymore, remember that treatment can help you regain your perspective — and life will get better. Take one step at a time and don't act impulsively.

1513,1,"Diagnosis
 
 Your doctor may do a physical exam, tests and in-depth questioning about your mental and physical health to help determine what may be causing your suicidal thinking and to determine the best treatment.
 
 Assessments may include:
 
 Mental health conditions. In most cases, suicidal thoughts are linked to an underlying mental health issue that can be treated. If this is the case, you may need to see a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental illness (psychiatrist) or other mental health provider.
 
 Physical health conditions. In some cases, suicidal thinking may be linked to an underlying physical health problem. You may need blood tests and other tests to determine whether this is the case.
 
 Alcohol and drug misuse. For many people, alcohol or drugs play a role in suicidal thinking and completed suicide. Your doctor will want to know whether you have any problems with alcohol or drug use — such as bingeing or being unable to cut back or quit using alcohol or drugs on your own. Many people who feel suicidal need treatment to help them stop using alcohol or drugs, to reduce their suicidal feelings.
 
 Medications. In some people, certain prescription or over-the-counter drugs can cause suicidal feelings. Tell your doctor about any medications you take to see whether they could be linked to your suicidal thinking.
 
 Children and teenagers
 
 Children who are feeling suicidal usually need to see a psychiatrist or psychologist experienced in diagnosing and treating children with mental health problems. In addition to patient discussion, the doctor will want to get an accurate picture of what's going on from a variety of sources, such as the parents or guardians, others close to the child or teen, school reports, and previous medical or psychiatric evaluations.

 Treatment
 
 Treatment of suicidal thoughts and behavior depends on your specific situation, including your level of suicide risk and what underlying problems may be causing your suicidal thoughts or behavior.
 
 Emergencies
 
 If you've attempted suicide and you're injured:
 
 Call 911 or your local emergency number.
 
 Have someone else call if you're not alone.
 
 If you're not injured, but you're at immediate risk of harming yourself:
 
 Call 911 or your local emergency number.
 
 Call a suicide hotline number — in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to reach a trained counselor. Use that same number and press ""1"" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line.
 
 At the emergency room, you'll be treated for any injuries. The doctor will ask you questions and may examine you, looking for recent or past signs of attempted suicide. Depending on your state of mind, you may need medications to calm you or to ease symptoms of an underlying mental illness, such as depression.
 
 Your doctor may want you to stay in the hospital long enough to make sure any treatments are working, that you'll be safe when you leave and that you'll get the follow-up treatment you need.
 
 Nonemergency situations
 
 If you have suicidal thoughts, but aren't in a crisis situation, you may need outpatient treatment. This treatment may include:
 
 Psychotherapy. In psychotherapy, also called psychological counseling or talk therapy, you explore the issues that make you feel suicidal and learn skills to help manage emotions more effectively. You and your therapist can work together to develop a treatment plan and goals.
 
 Medications. Antidepressants, antipsychotic medications, anti-anxiety medications and other medications for mental illness can help reduce symptoms, which can help you feel less suicidal.
 
 Addiction treatment. Treatment for drug or alcohol addiction can include detoxification, addiction treatment programs and self-help group meetings.
 
 Family support and education. Your loved ones can be both a source of support and conflict. Involving them in treatment can help them understand what you're going through, give them better coping skills, and improve family communication and relationships.
 
 Helping a loved one
 
 If you have a loved one who has attempted suicide, or if you think your loved one may be in danger of doing so, get emergency help. Don't leave the person alone.
 
 If you have a loved one you think may be considering suicide, have an open and honest discussion about your concerns. You may not be able to force someone to seek professional care, but you can offer encouragement and support. You can also help your loved one find a qualified doctor or mental health provider and make an appointment. You can even offer to go along.
 
 Supporting a loved one who is chronically suicidal can be stressful and exhausting. You may be afraid and feel guilty and helpless. Take advantage of resources about suicide and suicide prevention so that you have information and tools to take action when needed. Also, take care of yourself by getting support from family, friends, organizations and professionals.

 Lifestyle and home remedies
 
 There's no substitute for professional help when it comes to treating suicidal thinking and preventing suicide. However, there are a few things that may reduce suicide risk:
 
 Avoid drugs and alcohol. Alcohol and recreational drugs can worsen suicidal thoughts. They can also make you feel less inhibited, which means you're more likely to act on your thoughts.
 
 Form a strong support network. That may include family, friends or members of your church, synagogue or other place of worship. Religious practice has been shown to help reduce the risk of suicide.
 
 Get active. Physical activity and exercise have been shown to reduce depression symptoms. Consider walking, jogging, swimming, gardening or taking up another form of physical activity that you enjoy.
 
 Coping and support
 
 Don't try to manage suicidal thoughts or behavior on your own. You need professional help and support to overcome the problems linked to suicidal thinking. In addition:
 
 Go to your appointments. Don't skip therapy sessions or doctor's appointments, even if you don't want to go or don't feel like you need to.
 
 Take medications as directed. Even if you're feeling well, don't skip your medications. If you stop, your suicidal feelings may come back. You could also experience withdrawal-like symptoms from abruptly stopping an antidepressant or other medication.
 
 Learn about your condition. Learning about your condition can empower and motivate you to stick to your treatment plan. If you have depression, for instance, learn about its causes and treatments.
 
 Pay attention to warning signs. Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your suicidal feelings. Learn to spot the danger signs early, and decide what steps to take ahead of time. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in how you feel. Consider involving family members or friends in watching for warning signs.
 
 Make a plan so you know what to do if suicidal thoughts return. You may want to make a written agreement with a mental health provider or a loved one to help you anticipate the right steps to take when you don't have the best judgment. Clearly stating your suicidal intention with your therapist makes it possible to anticipate it and address it.
 
 Eliminate potential means of killing yourself. If you think you might act on suicidal thoughts, immediately get rid of any potential means of killing yourself, such as firearms, knives or dangerous medications. If you take medications that have a potential for overdose, have a family member or friend give you your medications as prescribed.
 
 Seek help from a support group. A number of organizations are available to help you cope with suicidal thinking and recognize that there are many options in your life other than suicide.
 
 Preparing for your appointment
 
 When you call your primary care doctor to set up an appointment, you may be referred immediately to a psychiatrist. If you're in danger of killing yourself, your doctor may have you get emergency help at the hospital.
 
 What you can do
 
 Take these steps before your appointment:
 
 Make a list of key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.
 
 Make a list of all medications, vitamins and other supplements that you're taking, and the doses. Be honest with your doctor about your alcohol and drug use.
 
 Ask a family member or friend to the appointment if possible — someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot.
 
 Make a list of questions to ask your doctor.
 
 Some basic questions to ask your doctor include:
 
 Could my suicidal thoughts be linked to an underlying mental or physical health problem?
 
 Will I need any tests for possible underlying conditions?
 
 Do I need immediate treatment of some kind? What will that involve?
 
 What are the alternatives to the approach that you're suggesting?
 
 I have these other mental or physical health problems. How can I best manage them together?
 
 Is there anything I can do to stay safe and feel better?
 
 Should I see a psychiatrist?
 
 Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing me?
 
 Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
 
 Don't hesitate to ask additional questions.
 
 What to expect from your doctor
 
 Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, such as:
 
 When did you first begin having suicidal thoughts?
 
 Have your suicidal thoughts been continuous or occasional?
 
 Have you ever tried to take your own life?
 
 Do you have a plan to kill yourself?
 
 If you have a plan, does it involve a specific method, place or time?
 
 Have you made any preparations, such as gathering pills or writing suicide notes?
 
 Do you feel like you can control your impulses when you feel like killing or hurting yourself?
 
 Do you have friends or family members you can talk to or go to for help?
 
 Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
 
 What medications do you take?
 
 Do you use recreational drugs?
 
 What, if anything, helps you deal with your suicidal thoughts?
 
 What, if anything, appears to worsen your suicidal thoughts?
 
 What are your feelings about the future? Do you have any hope that things will improve?
 
 Preparing and anticipating questions will help you make the most of your time with the doctor.
 
 What you can do in the meantime
 
 If you've scheduled an appointment and can't see your doctor immediately, make sure you stay safe. Contact family members, friends or other people you trust to help you. If you feel you're in danger of hurting yourself or attempting suicide, call 911 or get emergency help immediately.

 Medications
 
 Millions of Americans experience depression every year. Finding the right treatment can be a long, strenuous process, especially when you’re dealing with other mental health disorders. Working with a doctor or mental health professional is crucial when considering treatment options. Adderall, a stimulant, has been linked to depression for many reasons, both as an off-label treatment and a cause of depression.
 
 Adderall
 
 Adderall is a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. A stimulant, it affects chemicals in the brain and nerves that contribute to hyperactivity and impulse control. It is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is often used as part of a treatment plan, which can include psychological, education, or social measures.1",,

 In order for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder to be made, there must also be a history of or a current manic or hypomanic episode. In bipolar I disorder, there doesn't need to be a depressive episode, although most there is. In bipolar 2, there needs to be the presence of a hypomanic and a major depressive episode over the course of the illness. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) contains a list of specific symptoms that may be present and specifies several rules about those symptoms.
 
 For a diagnosis of a major depressive episode in bipolar disorder, the symptoms have to be continuous for at least two weeks (of course, they often continue much, much longer). In addition, at least one of the first two symptoms listed below must be present; at least five or more of all the symptoms listed must be present.

 Loneliness is a universal human emotion that is both complex and unique to each individual. Because it has no single common cause, the prevention and treatment of this potentially damaging state of mind can vary dramatically.
 
 For example, a lonely child who struggles to make friends at school has different needs than a lonely older adult whose spouse has recently died. In order to understand loneliness, it's important to take a closer look at exactly what we mean by the term ""lonely,"" as well as the various causes, health consequences, symptoms, and potential treatments for loneliness.

 Respiratory Depression Treatment
 
 Hypoventilation vs. Hyperventilation
 
 Prevention
 
 Respiratory depression, also known as hypoventilation or hypoventilatory syndrome, is the abnormal retention of carbon dioxide in the blood due to the poor exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen within the lungs.
 
 Slow and shallow breathing characterizes this breathing disorder, sometimes as low as 8 to 10 breaths per second. The normal breathing rate is between 12 and 20 breaths per second.
 
 During normal breathing, the blood carries inhaled oxygen to all the tissues of the body while removing carbon dioxide through the lungs as a waste product.
 
 With respiratory depression, the body cannot remove carbon dioxide efficiently, and as a result, there is a build-up of carbon dioxide with little oxygen available for the functioning of the body.
 
 Medical conditions that affect the brain and the functioning of the central nervous system can cause respiratory depression. Health conditions such as a stroke or sleep apnea can cause hypoventilation. It can also result from medication and other substances that impair brain function.
 
 If a person does not receive medical treatment, severe respiratory depression can lead to reduced heart rate, heart attack, respiratory attack, brain damage, coma, or death.
 
 Respiratory Depression Symptoms
 
 The symptoms of hypoventilation vary depending on the severity of the condition. Early symptoms can be mild and unspecific such as:
 
 Lethargy and tiredness
 
 Daytime sleepiness
 
 Slow and shallow breathing 
 
 Depression
 
 Shortness of breath
 
 If earlier symptoms are not addressed, then the severity of the condition can increase with the following symptoms:
 
 Confusion
 
 Disorientation
 
 Visual disturbance and headaches
 
 Labored breathing during activity and inactivity
 
 Bluish lips, fingers, and toes
 
 Increased daytime sleepiness and fatigue
 
 Difficulty staying awake and prolonged sleep at night
 
 Seizures
 
 Abnormally long pauses between breaths, known as apnea
 
 Nausea
 
 Abnormal breath sounds
 
 Diminished awareness and cognition
 
 Diagnosis
 
 It’s important to contact your doctor for a proper diagnosis of respiratory depression and to get treatment.
 
 Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and ask about any medications you're currently taking. The doctor will then make a further diagnosis with a physical examination and perform tests to determine the cause. These tests can include:
 
 Chest x-ray
 
 Lung function test
 
 Urine and serum drug screens
 
 Screening for alcohol and other toxins
 
 Blood gas test, which measures the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood, along with the acid/base ratio
 
 Hematocrit and hemoglobin blood test which measures the number of red blood cells available to carry oxygen
 
 Pulse oximetry test measures the oxygen level in your bloodstream
 
 CT and MRI scans to check for stroke or tumors
 
 Sleep study to diagnose sleep-related disorders
 
 Thyroid function test to determine hypothyroidism, which is a potential cause of obesity and thus contributes to hypoventilation
 
 Electrocardiography (ECG) test to determine signs of heart strain and other disorders
 
 Electroencephalogram (EEG) test to check electrical patterns in the brain for conditions like seizures, head injuries, brain tumors, and epilepsy
 
 Ammonia levels test to determine levels of ammonia in the blood
 
 Causes
 
 Some health conditions can cause respiratory depression, which impacts breathing rate. When this occurs, the lungs cannot ventilate fully.
 
 Neuromuscular Disorders
 
 People with neuromuscular disorders can develop rapid, shallow breathing because of respiratory muscle weakness and poor muscle control,1",,

 Coping 
 
 Grief is a person’s natural response to losing a loved one. It’s accompanied by feelings of hurt, loss, and sadness. Complicated grief, also known as complicated bereavement disorder, is a condition that can occur in some people who have just lost a loved one or are experiencing grief for another reason.
 
 While the intensity of grief usually fades with time for most people, these feelings don't improve for people with complicated grief. They might be so intense that they disrupt their day to day lives.
 
 A person with complicated grief might also display certain dysfunctional behaviors and might experience irrational thoughts, such as thoughts that the person who has died might come back to life. It’s a chronic form of grief that could impair one’s life. When grief lingers, complicated grief occurs. About 7% of bereaved people might experience complicated grief.1",,
1669,1,"Depression
 
 Overview
 
 Depression (major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks.
 
 Some forms of depression are slightly different, or they may develop under unique circumstances, such as:
 
 Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia) is a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years. A person diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder may have episodes of major depression along with periods of less severe symptoms, but symptoms must last for two years to be considered persistent depressive disorder.
 
 Postpartum depression is much more serious than the “baby blues” (relatively mild depressive and anxiety symptoms that typically clear within two weeks after delivery) that many women experience after giving birth. Women with postpartum depression experience full-blown major depression during pregnancy or after delivery (postpartum depression). The feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that accompany postpartum depression may make it difficult for these new mothers to complete daily care activities for themselves and/or for their babies.
 
 Psychotic depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis, such as having disturbing false fixed beliefs (delusions) or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see (hallucinations). The psychotic symptoms typically have a depressive “theme,” such as delusions of guilt, poverty, or illness.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder is characterized by the onset of depression during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. This depression generally lifts during spring and summer. Winter depression, typically accompanied by social withdrawal, increased sleep, and weight gain, predictably returns every year in seasonal affective disorder.
 
 Bipolar disorder is different from depression, but it is included in this list is because someone with bipolar disorder experiences episodes of extremely low moods that meet the criteria for major depression (called “bipolar depression”). But a person with bipolar disorder also experiences extreme high – euphoric or irritable – moods called “mania” or a less severe form called “hypomania.”
 
 Examples of other types of depressive disorders newly added to the diagnostic classification of DSM-5 include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (diagnosed in children and adolescents) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).
 
 Signs and Symptoms
 
 If you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:
 
 Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood
 
 Feelings of hopelessness, or pessimism
 
 Irritability
 
 Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
 
 Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
 
 Decreased energy or fatigue
 
 Moving or talking more slowly
 
 Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still
 
 Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
 
 Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
 
 Appetite and/or weight changes
 
 Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts
 
 Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause and/or that do not ease even with treatment
 
 Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. Some people experience only a few symptoms while others may experience many. Several persistent symptoms in addition to low mood are required for a diagnosis of major depression, but people with only a few – but distressing – symptoms may benefit from treatment of their “subsyndromal” depression. The severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the individual and his or her particular illness. Symptoms may also vary depending on the stage of the illness.
 
 Risk Factors
 
 Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the U.S. Current research suggests that depression is caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors.
 
 Depression can happen at any age, but often begins in adulthood. Depression is now recognized as occurring in children and adolescents, although it sometimes presents with more prominent irritability than low mood. Many chronic mood and anxiety disorders in adults begin as high levels of anxiety in children.
 
 Depression, especially in midlife or older adults, can co-occur with other serious medical illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and Parkinson’s disease. These conditions are often worse when depression is present. Sometimes medications taken for these physical illnesses may cause side effects that contribute to depression. A doctor experienced in treating these complicated illnesses can help work out the best treatment strategy.
 
 Risk factors include:
 
 Personal or family history of depression
 
 Major life changes, trauma, or stress
 
 Certain physical illnesses and medications
 
 Treatment and Therapies
 
 Depression, even the most severe cases, can be treated. The earlier that treatment can begin, the more effective it is. Depression is usually treated with medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and other brain stimulation therapies may be options to explore.
 
 Quick Tip: No two people are affected the same way by depression and there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" for treatment. It may take some trial and error to find the treatment that works best for you.
 
 Medications
 
 Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression. They may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. You may need to try several different antidepressant medicines before finding the one that improves your symptoms and has manageable side effects. A medication that has helped you or a close family member in the past will often be considered.
 
 Antidepressants take time – usually 2 to 4 weeks – to work, and often, symptoms such as sleep, appetite, and concentration problems improve before mood lifts, so it is important to give medication a chance before reaching a conclusion about its effectiveness. If you begin taking antidepressants, do not stop taking them without the help of a doctor. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and then stop taking the medication on their own, and the depression returns. When you and your doctor have decided it is time to stop the medication, usually after a course of 6 to 12 months, the doctor will help you slowly and safely decrease your dose. Stopping them abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms.
 
 Please Note: In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. This warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also says that patients of all ages taking antidepressants should be watched closely, especially during the first few weeks of treatment.
 
 If you are considering taking an antidepressant and you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about any increased health risks to you or your unborn or nursing child.
 
 To find the latest information about antidepressants, talk to your doctor and visit www.fda.gov.
 
 You may have heard about an herbal medicine called St. John's wort. Although it is a top-selling botanical product, the FDA has not approved its use as an over-the-counter or prescription medicine for depression, and there are serious concerns about its safety (it should never be combined with a prescription antidepressant) and effectiveness. Do not use St. John’s wort before talking to your health care provider. Other natural products sold as dietary supplements, including omega-3 fatty acids and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), remain under study but have not yet been proven safe and effective for routine use. For more information on herbal and other complementary approaches and current research, please visit the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health website.
 
 Psychotherapies
 
 Several types of psychotherapy (also called “talk therapy” or, in a less specific form, counseling) can help people with depression. Examples of evidence-based approaches specific to the treatment of depression include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and problem-solving therapy. More information on psychotherapy is available on the NIMH Psychotherapies webpage.
 
 Brain Stimulation Therapies
 
 If medications do not reduce the symptoms of depression, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be an option to explore. Based on the latest research:
 
 ECT can provide relief for people with severe depression who have not been able to feel better with other treatments.
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy can be an effective treatment for depression. In some severe cases where a rapid response is necessary or medications cannot be used safely, ECT can even be a first-line intervention.
 
 Once strictly an inpatient procedure, today ECT is often performed on an outpatient basis. The treatment consists of a series of sessions, typically three times a week, for two to four weeks.
 
 ECT may cause some side effects, including confusion, disorientation, and memory loss. Usually these side effects are short-term, but sometimes memory problems can linger, especially for the months around the time of the treatment course. Advances in ECT devices and methods have made modern ECT safe and effective for the vast majority of patients. Talk to your doctor and make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of the treatment before giving your informed consent to undergoing ECT.
 
 ECT is not painful, and you cannot feel the electrical impulses. Before ECT begins, a patient is put under brief anesthesia and given a muscle relaxant. Within one hour after the treatment session, which takes only a few minutes, the patient is awake and alert.
 
 Other more recently introduced types of brain stimulation therapies used to treat medicine-resistant depression include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Other types of brain stimulation treatments are under study. You can learn more about these therapies on the NIMH Brain Stimulation Therapies webpage.
 
 If you think you may have depression, start by making an appointment to see your doctor or health care provider. This could be your primary care practitioner or a health provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. Visit the NIMH Find Help for Mental Illnesses if you are unsure of where to start.
 
 Beyond Treatment: Things You Can Do
 
 Here are other tips that may help you or a loved one during treatment for depression:
 
 Try to be active and exercise.
 
 Set realistic goals for yourself.
 
 Try to spend time with other people and confide in a trusted friend or relative.
 
 Try not to isolate yourself, and let others help you.
 
 Expect your mood to improve gradually, not immediately.
 
 Postpone important decisions, such as getting married or divorced, or changing jobs until you feel better. Discuss decisions with others who know you well and have a more objective view of your situation.

 Introduction
 
 Suicide is a major public health concern. In 2019, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death overall in the United States, claiming the lives of over 47,500 people.  Suicide is complicated and tragic, but it is often preventable. Knowing the warning signs for suicide and how to get help can help save lives.
 
 Signs and Symptoms
 
 The behaviors listed below may be signs that someone is thinking about suicide.
 
 Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill themselves
 
 Talking about feeling empty, hopeless, or having no reason to live
 
 Making a plan or looking for a way to kill themselves, such as searching for lethal methods online, stockpiling pills, or buying a gun
 
 Talking about great guilt or shame
 
 Talking about feeling trapped or feeling that there are no solutions
 
 Feeling unbearable pain (emotional pain or physical pain)
 
 Talking about being a burden to others
 
 Using alcohol or drugs more often
 
 Acting anxious or agitated
 
 Withdrawing from family and friends
 
 Changing eating and/or sleeping habits
 
 Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge
 
 Taking great risks that could lead to death, such as driving extremely fast
 
 Talking or thinking about death often
 
 Displaying extreme mood swings, suddenly changing from very sad to very calm or happy
 
 Giving away important possessions
 
 Saying goodbye to friends and family
 
 Putting affairs in order, making a will
 
 If these warning signs apply to you or someone you know, get help as soon as possible, particularly if the behavior is new or has increased recently.
 
 Here are five steps you can take to #BeThe1To help someone in emotional pain:
 
 ASK: “Are you thinking about killing yourself?” It’s not an easy question, but studies show that asking at-risk individuals if they are suicidal does not increase suicides or suicidal thoughts.
 
 KEEP THEM SAFE: Reducing a suicidal person’s access to highly lethal items or places is an important part of suicide prevention. While this is not always easy, asking if the at-risk person has a plan and removing or disabling the lethal means can make a difference.
 
 BE THERE: Listen carefully and learn what the individual is thinking and feeling. Research suggests acknowledging and talking about suicide may reduce rather than increase suicidal thoughts.
 
 HELP THEM CONNECT: Save the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s (1-800-273-TALK (8255)) and the Crisis Text Line’s number (741741) in your phone, so it’s there when you need it. You can also help make a connection with a trusted individual like a family member, friend, spiritual advisor, or mental health professional.
 
 STAY CONNECTED: Staying in touch after a crisis or after being discharged from care can make a difference. Studies have shown the number of suicide deaths goes down when someone follows up with the at-risk person.
 
 Risk Factors
 
 Suicide does not discriminate. People of all genders, ages, and ethnicities can be at risk. Suicidal behavior is complex, and there is no single cause. Many different factors contribute to someone making a suicide attempt. But people most at risk tend to share specific characteristics. The main risk factors for suicide are:
 
 Depression, other mental disorders, or substance abuse disorder
 
 Certain medical conditions
 
 Chronic pain
 
 A prior suicide attempt
 
 Family history of a mental disorder or substance abuse
 
 Family history of suicide
 
 Family violence, including physical or sexual abuse
 
 Having guns or other firearms in the home
 
 Having recently been released from prison or jail
 
 Being exposed to others' suicidal behavior, such as that of family members, peers, or celebrities
 
 Many people have some of these risk factors but do not attempt suicide. It is important to note that suicide is not a normal response to stress. Suicidal thoughts or actions are a sign of extreme distress, not a harmless bid for attention, and should not be ignored.
 
 Often, family and friends are the first to recognize the warning signs of suicide and can be the first step toward helping an at-risk individual find treatment with someone who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. See the resources on NIMH’s Find Help for Mental Illnesses page if you're not sure where to start.
 
 Suicide is complex. Treatments and therapies for people with suicidal thoughts or actions will vary with age, gender, physical and mental well-being, and with individual experiences. NIMH has focused research on identifying people at risk for suicide and identifying effective interventions.
 
 Identifying People at Risk for Suicide
 
 Universal Screening: Research has shown that a three-question screening tool helps emergency room personnel identify adults at risk for suicide. Researchers found that screening all patients – regardless of the reason for their emergency room visit – doubled the number of patients identified as being at risk for suicide. The researchers estimated that suicide-risk screening tools could identify more than three million additional adults at risk for suicide each year.
 
 Predicting Suicide Risk Using Electronic Health Records: Researchers from NIMH partnered with the VA and others to develop computer programs that could help predict suicide risk among veterans receiving VA health care. Other healthcare systems are beginning to use data from electronic health records to help identify people with suicide risk as well.
 
 Treatments and Therapies
 
 Brief Interventions
 
 Safety Planning: Personalized safety planning has been shown to help reduce suicidal thoughts and actions. Patients work with a caregiver to develop a plan that describes ways to limit access to lethal means such as firearms, pills, or poisons. The plan also lists coping strategies and people and resources that can help in a crisis.
 
 Follow-up phone calls: Research has shown that when at-risk patients receive further screening, a Safety Plan intervention, and a series of supportive phone calls, their risk of suicide goes down.
 
 Psychotherapies
 
 Multiple types of psychosocial interventions have been found to help individuals who have attempted suicide (see below). These types of interventions may prevent someone from making another attempt.
 
 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help people learn new ways of dealing with stressful experiences through training. CBT helps individuals recognize their thought patterns and consider alternative actions when thoughts of suicide arise.
 
 Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) has been shown to reduce suicidal behavior in adolescents. DBT has also been shown to reduce the rate of suicide in adults with borderline personality disorder, a mental illness characterized by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image, and behavior that often results in impulsive actions and problems in relationships. A therapist trained in DBT helps a person recognize when his or her feelings or actions are disruptive or unhealthy, and teaches the skills needed to deal better with upsetting situations.
 
 NIMH’s Find Help for Mental Illnesses page can help you locate a mental health provider in your area. Here are tips to help prepare and guide you on how to talk to your health care provider about your mental health and get the most of your doctor’s visit.
 
 Medication
 
 Some individuals at risk for suicide might benefit from medication. Doctors and patients can work together to find the best medication or medication combination, as well as the right dose. Because many individuals at risk for suicide often have a mental illness and substance use problems, individuals might benefit from medication along with psychosocial intervention.
 
 Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication used primarily to treat individuals with schizophrenia. To date, it is the only medication with a specific U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
 
 If you are prescribed a medication, be sure you:
 
 Talk with your doctor or a pharmacist to make sure you understand the risks and benefits of the medications you're taking.
 
 Do not stop taking a medication without talking to your doctor first. Suddenly stopping a medication may lead to ""rebound"" or worsening of symptoms. Other uncomfortable or potentially dangerous withdrawal effects also are possible.
 
 Report any concerns about side effects to your doctor right away. You may need a change in the dose or a different medication.
 
 Report serious side effects to the FDA MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online or by phone at 1-800-332-1088. You or your doctor may send a report.
 
 Other medications have been used to treat suicidal thoughts and behaviors, but more research is needed to show the benefit of these options. For basic information about these medications, you can visit the NIMH Mental Health Medications webpage. For the most up-to-date information on medications, side effects, and warnings, visit the FDA website.
 
 Collaborative Care
 
 Collaborative Care has been shown to be an effective way to treat depression and reduce suicidal thoughts. A team-based Collaborative Care program adds two new types of services to usual primary care: behavioral health care management and consultations with a mental health specialist.
 
 The behavioral health care manager becomes part of the patient’s treatment team and helps the primary care provider evaluate the patient’s mental health. If the patient receives a diagnosis of a mental health disorder and wants treatment, the care manager, primary care provider, and patient work together to develop a treatment plan. This plan may include medication, psychotherapy, or other appropriate options.
 
 Later, the care manager reaches out to see if the patient likes the plan, is following the plan, and if the plan is working or if changes are needed to improve management of the patient’s disorders. The care manager and the primary care provider also regularly review the patient’s status and care plan with a mental health specialist, like a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse, to be sure the patient is getting the best treatment options and improving.
 
 Ongoing Research
 
 To know who is most at risk and to prevent suicide, scientists need to understand the role of long-term factors (such as childhood experiences) as well as more immediate factors like mental health and recent life events. Researchers also are looking at how genes can either increase risk or make someone more resilient to loss and hardships.
 
 Recent findings from NIMH-funded research are listed in the Research and Statistics section below, and NIMH along with other NIH Institutes are funding a number of ongoing studies related to suicide.",,
1678,0,"Coping with Traumatic Events
 
 Overview
 
 A traumatic event is a shocking, scary, or dangerous experience that can affect someone emotionally and physically. Experiences like natural disasters (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods), acts of violence (such as assault, abuse, terrorist attacks, and mass shootings), as well as car crashes and other accidents can all be traumatic. Researchers are investigating the factors that help people cope or that increase their risk for other physical or mental health problems following a traumatic event.
 
 Warning Signs
 
 Responses to trauma can be immediate or delayed, brief or prolonged. Most people have intense responses immediately following, and often for several weeks or months after a traumatic event. These responses can include:
 
 Feeling anxious, sad, or angry
 
 Trouble concentrating and sleeping
 
 Continually thinking about what happened
 
 For most people, these are normal and expected responses and generally lessen with time.
 
 In some cases, these responses continue for a longer period of time and interfere with everyday life. If they are interfering with daily life or are not getting better over time, it is important to seek professional help. Some signs that an individual may need help include:
 
 Worrying a lot or feeling very anxious, sad, or fearful
 
 Crying often
 
 Having trouble thinking clearly
 
 Having frightening thoughts or flashbacks, reliving the experience
 
 Feeling angry, resentful, or irritable
 
 Having nightmares or difficulty sleeping
 
 Avoiding places or people that bring back disturbing memories and responses.
 
 Becoming isolated from family and friends
 
 Children and teens can have different reactions to trauma than those of adults. Symptoms sometimes seen in very young children (less than six years old) can include:
 
 Wetting the bed after having learned to use the toilet
 
 Forgetting how to or being unable to talk
 
 Acting out the scary event during playtime
 
 Being unusually clingy with a parent or other adult
 
 Older children and teens are more likely to show symptoms similar to those seen in adults. They may also develop disruptive, disrespectful, or destructive behaviors. Older children and teens may feel guilty for not preventing injury or deaths. They may also have thoughts of revenge.
 
 Physical responses to trauma may also mean that an individual needs help. Physical symptoms may include:
 
 Headaches
 
 Stomach pain and digestive issues
 
 Feeling tired
 
 Racing heart and sweating
 
 Being very jumpy and easily startled
 
 Individuals who have a mental health condition or who have had traumatic experiences in the past, who face ongoing stress, or who lack support from friends and family may be more likely to develop more severe symptoms and need additional help. Some people turn to alcohol or other drugs to cope with their symptoms. Although substance use may seem to relieve symptoms temporarily, it can also lead to new problems and get in the way of recovery.
 
 Ways to Cope
 
 Healthy ways of coping in this time period include:
 
 Avoiding alcohol and other drugs;
 
 Spending time with loved ones and trusted friends who are supportive; and
 
 Trying to maintain normal routines for meals, exercise, and sleep.
 
 In general, staying active is a good way to cope with stressful feelings.
 
 Finding Help
 
 Mental health conditions can be treated. If you or someone you know needs help, talk with your health care provider. For tips for getting the most out of the visit, see NIMH's Taking Control of Your Mental Health: Tips for Talking with Your Health Care Provider. If you are unsure where to go for help, visit NIMH’s Help for Mental Illnesses webpage.
 
 If You Know Someone in Crisis
 
 Some symptoms require immediate emergency care. If you or someone you know is thinking about harming themselves or others or attempting suicide, seek help right away:
 
 Call 911 for emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room.
 
 Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Lifeline) at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or text the Crisis Text Line (text HELLO to 741741).
 
 Contact social media outlets directly if you are concerned about a person’s social media updates or dial 911 in an emergency. For more information about how to contact social media outlets, visit the Lifeline’s Support on Social Media webpage.
 
 Take any comments about suicide or wishing to die seriously—even those said by children and adolescents. Even if you do not believe your family member or friend will attempt suicide, the person is in distress and can benefit from your help in finding treatment. You can learn more about suicide prevention on NIMH’s Suicide Prevention webpage.

 Join a Study
 
 Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.
 
 Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials uncovered years ago. Be part of tomorrow’s medical breakthroughs. Talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.

1680,0,"Alzheimer's or depression: Could it be both?
 
 Alzheimer's and depression have some similar symptoms. Proper treatment improves quality of life.
 
 By Mayo Clinic Staff
 
 Early Alzheimer's disease and depression share many symptoms, so it can be hard — even for doctors — to distinguish between the disorders. Plus, many people with Alzheimer's disease also are depressed.
 
 Just as treatment is important for people with depression alone, it's equally crucial for people with Alzheimer's disease and depression to get treatment for their depression.
 
 People who have both Alzheimer's and depression may find it easier to cope with the changes caused by Alzheimer's when they feel less depressed.
 
 Some of the symptoms common to both Alzheimer's and depression include:
 
 Loss of interest in once-enjoyable activities and hobbies
 
 Social withdrawal
 
 Memory problems
 
 Sleeping too much or too little
 
 Impaired concentration
 
 With so much overlap in symptoms, it can be hard to tell the difference between the two disorders, especially since they often occur together. A thorough physical exam and psychological evaluation can be helpful in making a diagnosis.
 
 But, many people with more advanced Alzheimer's disease may not be able to express how they feel.
 
 To detect depression in people who have Alzheimer's disease, doctors must rely more heavily on nonverbal cues and caregiver reports than on self-reported symptoms. If a person with Alzheimer's displays one of the first two symptoms in this list, along with at least two of the others within a two-week period, he or she may be depressed.
 
 Significantly depressed mood — sad, hopeless, discouraged, tearful
 
 Reduced pleasure in or response to social contacts and usual activities
 
 Social isolation or withdrawal
 
 Eating too much or too little
 
 Sleeping too much or too little
 
 Agitation or lethargy
 
 Irritability
 
 Fatigue or loss of energy
 
 Feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness or inappropriate guilt
 
 Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide
 
 People with Alzheimer's may experience depression differently from that of people without Alzheimer's. For example, individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease:
 
 May have symptoms of depression that are less severe
 
 May experience episodes of depression that don't last as long or come back as frequently
 
 Seem less likely to talk of suicide and attempt suicide less often
 
 Scientists aren't sure of the exact relationship between Alzheimer's disease and depression. The biological changes caused by Alzheimer's may intensify a predisposition to depression.
 
 On the other hand, depression may increase the chances of developing Alzheimer's disease.
 
 It's clear that depression has a strong effect on quality of life for people with Alzheimer's disease. Depression can lead to:
 
 Worsening cognitive decline
 
 Greater disability involving daily living skills
 
 Increased dependence on caregivers
 
 Several options are available to treat people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and depression:
 
 Antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — for example, citalopram (Celexa) and sertraline (Zoloft) — are usually the first antidepressants chosen for people who have depression and Alzheimer's. These medications have a low risk of side effects and drug interactions.
 
 However, these medications may not be as effective at treating depression with Alzheimer's as they are at treating depression alone. Other antidepressants, such as venlafaxine (Effexor XR) or bupropion (Aplenzin, Wellbutrin, others), also may be used.
 
 Physical exercise. Regular physical exercise may help ease the symptoms of depression.
 
 Support groups and counseling. Support groups and professional counseling may help people with depression in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, before their communication skills deteriorate.
 
 Decreasing social isolation. Continuing to participate in activities with other people may decrease depressive symptoms. It may also be helpful to find ways for your loved one with Alzheimer's disease to contribute to family activities, and let them know you appreciate their contribution.
 
 Making the diagnosis of depression in people with Alzheimer's disease and getting appropriate treatment can help make life easier and more enjoyable for both the person with Alzheimer's and his or her caregivers.",,

 Summary
 
 Read the full fact sheet
 
 Depression is a constant feeling of sadness and loss of interest, which stops you doing your normal activities.
 
 Different types of depression exist, with symptoms ranging from relatively minor to severe.
 
 Generally, depression does not result from a single event, but from a mix of events and factors.
 
 If you feel depressed, see your doctor. Don’t delay. Seeking support early can help stop symptoms becoming worse.

 Where to get help
 
 While we all feel sad, moody or low from time to time, some people experience these feelings intensely, for long periods of time (weeks, months or even years) and sometimes without any apparent reason. Depression is more than just a low mood – it's a serious condition that has an impact on both physical and mental health. 
 
 Depression is common
 
 In any one year, around one million people in Australia experience depression. One in six women and one in eight men will experience depression at some time in their life. The good news is, depression is treatable and effective treatments are available. The sooner a person with depression seeks support, the sooner they can recover.
 
 Symptoms of depression
 
 Depression affects how people think, feel and act. Depression makes it more difficult to manage from day to day and interferes with study, work and relationships. A person may be depressed if for more than two weeks they have felt sad, down or miserable most of the time or have lost interest or pleasure in most of their usual activities, and have also experienced several of the signs and symptoms across at least three of the categories in the list below. It’s important to note, everyone experiences some of these symptoms from time to time and it may not necessarily mean a person is depressed. Equally, not every person who is experiencing depression will have all of these symptoms.  
 
 Feelings caused by depression
 
 A person with depression may feel:
 
 sad 
 
 miserable
 
 unhappy
 
 irritable
 
 overwhelmed
 
 guilty
 
 frustrated
 
 lacking in confidence
 
 indecisive
 
 unable to concentrate
 
 disappointed.
 
 Thoughts caused by depression
 
 A person with depression may have thoughts such as:
 
 ‘I’m a failure.’
 
 ‘It’s my fault.’
 
 ‘Nothing good ever happens to me.’
 
 ‘I’m worthless.’
 
 ‘There is nothing good in my life.’
 
 ‘Things will never change.’
 
 ‘Life’s not worth living.’
 
 ‘People would be better off without me.’
 
 Behavioural symptoms of depression
 
 A person with depression may:
 
 withdraw from close family and friends
 
 stop going out
 
 stop their usual enjoyable activities
 
 not get things done at work or school
 
 rely on alcohol and sedatives.
 
 Physical symptoms of depression
 
 A person with depression may experience:
 
 being tired all the time
 
 feeling sick and ‘run down’
 
 frequent headaches, stomach or muscle pains
 
 a churning gut
 
 sleep problems
 
 loss or change of appetite
 
 significant weight loss or gain.
 
 Causes of depression
 
 While the exact cause of depression isn’t known, a number of things can be associated with its development. Generally, depression does not result from a single event, but from a combination of biological, psychological, social and lifestyle factors.
 
 Personal factors that can lead to depression
 
 Personal factors that can lead to a risk of depression include:
 
 family history – depression can run in families and some people will be at an increased genetic risk. However, this doesn’t mean that a person will automatically experience depression if a parent or close relative has had the condition.
 
 personality – some people may be more at risk because of their personality, particularly if they tend to worry a lot, have low self-esteem, are perfectionists, are sensitive to personal criticism, or are self-critical and negative
 
 serious medical conditions – these can trigger depression in two ways. Serious conditions can bring about depression directly or can contribute to depression through the associated stress and worry, especially if it involves long-term management of a condition or chronic pain
 
 drug and alcohol use – can both lead to and result from depression. Many people with depression also have drug and alcohol problems. 
 
 Life events and depression
 
 Research suggests that continuing difficulties, such as long-term unemployment, living in an abusive or uncaring relationship, long-term isolation or loneliness or prolonged exposure to stress at work can increase the risk of depression. 
 
 Significant adverse life events, such as losing a job, going through a separation or divorce, or being diagnosed with a serious illness, may also trigger depression, particularly among people who are already at risk because of genetic, developmental or other personal factors.
 
 Changes in the brain
 
 Although there has been a lot of research in this complex area, there is still much that we do not know. Depression is not simply the result of a chemical imbalance, for example because a person has too much or not enough of a particular brain chemical. However, disturbances in normal chemical messaging processes between nerve cells in the brain are believed to contribute to depression. 
 
 Some factors that can lead to faulty mood regulation in the brain include:
 
 genetic vulnerability
 
 severe life stressors
 
 taking some medications, drugs and alcohol
 
 some medical conditions.
 
 Most modern antidepressants have an effect on the brain’s chemical transmitters, in particular serotonin and noradrenaline, which relay messages between brain cells. This is thought to be how medications work for depression. 
 
 Other medical treatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may sometimes be recommended for people with severe depression who have not recovered with lifestyle change, social support, psychological therapy and medication. While these treatments also have an impact on the brain’s chemical messaging process between nerve cells, the precise ways in which these treatments work is still being researched.  
 
 Seek support for symptoms of depression
 
 Depression is often not recognised and can go on for months or even years if left untreated. It’s important to seek support as early as possible, as the sooner a person gets treatment, the sooner they can recover. 
 
 Untreated depression can have many negative effects on a person’s life, including serious relationship and family problems, difficulty finding and holding down a job, and drug and alcohol problems. 
 
 There is no one proven way that people recover from depression. However, there is a range of effective treatments and health professionals who can help people on the road to recovery. 
 
 There are also many things that people with depression can do for themselves to help them recover and stay well. The important thing is to find the right treatment and the right health professional for a person’s needs.
 
 Types of depression
 
 There are different types of depression. The symptoms for each can range from relatively minor through to severe. 
 
 Major depression
 
 Major depression, or major depressive disorder is the technical term used by health professionals and researchers to describe the most common type of depression. Other terms sometimes used include unipolar depression or clinical depression. 
 
 Depression can be described as mild, moderate or severe.
 
 Melancholia
 
 Melancholia is an older term for depression and is still sometimes used to describe a more severe form of depression with a strong biological basis, where many of the physical symptoms of depression are particularly evident. For example, one of the major changes is that the person can be observed to move more slowly, or to be experiencing significant changes to their sleep pattern and appetite. 
 
 A person with melancholia is also more likely to have a depressed mood that is characterised by complete loss of pleasure in everything or almost everything.
 
 Dysthymia
 
 The symptoms of dysthymia (sometimes called Persistent Depressive Disorder) are similar to those of major depression, but are less severe and more persistent. A person has to have this milder depression for more than two years to be diagnosed with dysthymia.
 
 Psychotic depression
 
 Sometimes, people with a depressive condition can lose touch with reality. This can involve hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) or delusions (false beliefs that are not shared by others), such as believing they are bad or evil, or that they are being watched or followed or that everyone is against them. This is known as psychotic depression.
 
 Antenatal and postnatal depression
 
 Women are at an increased risk of depression during pregnancy (known as the antenatal or prenatal period) and in the year following childbirth (known as the postnatal period). This time frame (the period covered by pregnancy and the first year after the baby’s birth) may also be referred to as the perinatal period.
 
 The causes of depression at this time can be complex and are often the result of a combination of factors. In the days immediately following birth, many women experience the ‘baby blues’, which is a common condition related to hormonal changes, affecting up to 80 per cent of women who have given birth. 
 
 The ‘baby blues’, or the general stress of adjusting to pregnancy or a new baby, are common experiences, but are different from depression. 
 
 Depression is longer lasting and can affect not only the mother, but her relationship with her baby, the child’s development, the mother’s relationship with her partner and with other members of the family.
 
 Up to one in 10 women will experience depression during pregnancy. This increases to 16 per cent in the first three months after having a baby.
 
 Bipolar disorder
 
 Bipolar disorder used to be known as ‘manic depression’ because the person experiences periods of depression and periods of mania with periods of normal mood in between. The symptoms of mania are opposite to the symptoms of depression and can vary in intensity. They include:
 
 feeling great
 
 having plenty of energy
 
 racing thoughts
 
 little need for sleep
 
 talking fast
 
 having difficulty focusing on tasks
 
 feeling frustrated and irritable. 
 
 This is not just a fleeting experience. Sometimes, the person loses touch with reality and experiences hallucinations or delusions, particularly about their ideas, abilities or importance. A family history of bipolar disorder can increase a person’s risk of experiencing bipolar disorder. 
 
 Because bipolar disorder includes periods of depression, it is not uncommon for a person with bipolar disorder to be misdiagnosed as having major depression until they have a manic or hypomanic episode. Bipolar disorder can also sometimes be confused with other mental health conditions such as schizophrenia. 
 
 The treatment for bipolar disorder is often different to that for major depression. It is therefore important to check for this condition whenever a person is being assessed for depression. 
 
 Cyclothymic disorder
 
 Cyclothymic disorder is an uncommon condition which is often described as a milder form of bipolar disorder. The person experiences chronic fluctuating moods over at least two years, involving periods of hypomania (a mild to moderate level of mania) and periods of depressive symptoms, with very short periods (no more than two months) of normality between. 
 
 The symptoms last for a shorter time, are less severe, and are not as regular, so they don’t fit the criteria of bipolar disorder or major depression.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
 
 SAD is a mood disorder that has a seasonal pattern. The cause is unclear, but may be related to the variation in light exposure in different seasons. SAD is characterised by mood disturbances (either periods of depression or mania) that begin and end in a particular season. Depression in winter only is the most common way in which people experience SAD. 
 
 SAD is usually diagnosed after the person has had the same symptoms during winter for two or more years. People with SAD are more likely to experience lack of energy, sleep too much, overeat, gain weight and crave carbohydrates. 
 
 SAD is rare in Australia, and more likely to be found in countries with short days and longer periods of darkness, such as the cold climate in the Northern Hemisphere.

 Self-harm is when people deliberately hurt their bodies.
 
 People sometimes self-harm as a way to cope with strong physical or emotional pain and distress.

 What is self-harm?
 
 Self-harm is a term that has historically been used to cover a broad range of behaviours. It refers to deliberately causing pain or damage to your own body, and can be suicidal or non-suicidal in intent. Self-injury is a type of self-harm, and refers to deliberately causing pain or damage to your own body without suicidal intent.
 
 Self-injury is more common in young people. Some people who self-harm may also have suicidal thoughts.
 
 Self-harm can take on different forms and its frequency can vary from person to person – some may do it once, while others can do it for many years. It can include:
 
 cutting, burning, biting or scratching the skin
 
 picking at wounds or scabs so they don’t heal
 
 pulling out hair, punching or hitting the body
 
 taking harmful substances (such as poisons, or over-the-counter or prescription medications).
 
 Self-harm is normally a sign that a person is feeling intense emotional pain and distress. 
 
 There are many support options for self-harming behaviour, whether you are seeking support for yourself or someone you care about.
 
 Getting support for self-harming behaviour
 
 If you are self-harming and you are worried, try to talk to someone you trust – like a friend, family member, doctor, teacher or school counsellor. It can be hard to build up the courage to open up to someone, but remember, they care about your wellbeing. It may take time for them to understand, but it doesn’t mean they aren’t there for you. 
 
 If you would rather talk to someone you don’t know, there are many options. You can:
 
 See a doctor, counsellor or psychologist. If you have a mental health condition, your GP can work with you to draft up a mental health treatment plan, which can include counselling sessions at a low cost.
 
 Contact eheadspace to talk to a counsellor. You can do this online or over the phone (Tel. 1800 650 890 – normal call charges apply on mobile). It’s confidential, so you don’t have to give your name, and it’s available to young people aged 12–25 and their families and friends.
 
 Visit a headspace centre – there are centres all over Australia where young people (12–25 years) can get health advice, information and support – usually free or at a low cost.
 
 Call Kids Helpline (Tel 1800 55 1800) – Kids Helpline is for young people aged between five and 25. You can talk to a counsellor about anything at any time.
 
 Call Beyond Blue to talk to a counsellor at any time (Tel. 1300 22 4636). Youthbeyondblue also provides youth-friendly information on self-harm.
 
 Visit ReachOut for youth-friendly information on self-harm, and online programs to help young people who may have depression and anxiety.
 
 Seeking help for suicidal thoughts
 
 Sometimes the distress you feel can be so overwhelming that you may have thoughts about ending your life. 
 
 If you are thinking about suicide, don’t be afraid to ask for support – talk to someone you trust and feel comfortable with, such as a family member, friend, teacher, doctor or other health professional.
 
 If you or someone you know is badly hurt or is at serious risk of harm, contact emergency services. Dial triple zero (000) or visit your nearest emergency department. You can also contact your doctor or mental health crisis service.
 
 You can also call:

 How do I know if someone is self-harming?
 
 It can be difficult to recognise whether someone is self-harming as many people who self-harm keep it a secret. Trust your instincts, especially if you think they are distressed or in trouble. Some signs may include:
 
 new marks on the body (such as bruises, cuts or burns)
 
 withdrawal from friends, family, school and work
 
 a drop in performance at school, work or activities
 
 changes in mood, sleep and eating patterns
 
 avoidance – not attending activities they once enjoyed or avoiding occasions where their injuries will be exposed (such as the beach or pool)
 
 wearing unsuitable clothing to cover up wounds 
 
 making excuses for injuries or behaviour
 
 being secretive – hiding sharp or dangerous objects.
 
 Supporting someone who self-harms
 
 People who self-harm need care, understanding and support in order to recover. Stigma from others can be damaging and may stop them from getting the support they need. According to a 2012 report by Orygen (Looking the other way: young people and self-harm), it is thought up to half the people who self-harm never seek help. 
 
 If you think someone you know might be self-harming, it is important to try to talk to them about it, and encourage them to seek professional help. Don’t try to force them to stop, as it can make matters worse. Talking to people who self-harm about their behaviour can be safe and very helpful if done in a supportive way.
 
 How to talk with someone who self-harms
 
 It can be difficult to approach someone who is self-harming. If you cannot do it on your own, ask someone else for help. 
 
 ReachOut and eheadspace have some helpful advice on how to start a conversation with someone who self-harms. Try the following suggestions:
 
 Ask them how things are going or how they are feeling.
 
 Let them know you are there if they feel down or stressed.
 
 Tell them you are worried about them, and why.
 
 Ask if they are thinking about suicide. If they are, or you think they might be, call your local hospital or mental health service. Or call a helpline such as Lifeline (Tel. 13 11 14) or SuicideLine (Tel. 1300 651 251).
 
 Stay calm, listen carefully and don’t judge them. If they seem upset or angry it may just mean they are feeling ashamed or worried about what you might think.
 
 Encourage them to seek support from a person they trust –such as a GP, teacher or counsellor.
 
 If the person who is self-harming is not ready to talk about it, try another time or suggest they speak to someone who makes them feel comfortable.
 
 Other ways to lower their distress may include:
 
 distraction – go for a walk, play a game, watch a movie or listen to their favourite music
 
 diversion – find a substitute action that causes no injury (such as punching a pillow or squeezing an ice cube)
 
 deep breathing.
 
 It can be helpful to draft up a safety plan or learn mental health first aid so you know what to do in a crisis.
 
 Encourage the person to seek support for themselves, or offer to help them make contact with one or more of the suggested supports.
 
 Support people need support too
 
 If your child, friend or other family member is self-harming, or you think they might be, seeking support from a mental health professional is important for you too. Talk to someone you trust about what’s going on and how you feel. However, upsetting it can be to see a loved one in trouble, remember that self-harming behaviour is treatable and not everyone who self-harms is suicidal.
 
 Self-harming behaviour is treatable
 
 Self-harming is a serious behaviour – it’s a sign someone is feeling significant distress and they’re not doing it to seek attention. Usually they are deeply ashamed and go to great lengths to hide it from others. They may suffer in silence and really need support to open up about how they are feeling. 
 
 Although self-harming behaviour can be treated, many people don’t seek support because they:
 
 think people will not understand 
 
 do not trust their information will be kept private
 
 do not believe anyone will be able to help
 
 are afraid people (including health professionals) will react negatively to their self-harming behaviour – perhaps because they have in the past
 
 are ashamed, guilty or angry about their self-harming behaviour
 
 believe they should be able to cope on their own. 
 
 No one has to cope alone; self-harming behaviour is treatable. Support can include working on recognising triggers, learning how to manage difficult emotions and help with self-care (such as caring for wounds and learning other coping strategies).
 
 For anyone who self-harms, just realising it is a not a long-term solution to problems is a step in the right direction. Once they make a decision to seek support, it’s important that they take it slowly and are not too hard on themselves. It can take time to break the cycle of self-harm and there may be setbacks along the way. 
 
 Finding alternatives to self-harm
 
 It can be difficult to break away from self-harm. Treatment will include learning to find other ways to manage intense feelings. By distracting or diverting the behaviour, feelings and urges may become less intense and decrease over time.
 
 The person who is self-harming may like to develop their own ways to distract themselves, or use some of these ideas:
 
 wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it when you feel distressed
 
 eat an ice-cube – the sensation can take your mind off intense feelings
 
 hold an ice-cube in your hand
 
 keep a journal and jot down your thoughts
 
 exercise – it releases endorphins and can help lift your mood
 
 be mindful – do some colouring, try meditation, relaxation or do a craft activity like knitting or painting
 
 draw on your body in the areas where you normally hurt
 
 punch a pillow
 
 make your environment safe – get someone you trust to take away any harmful objects and keep you away from any places where you are likely to harm
 
 keep a distraction box – store some things that bring you comfort in a box or bag (such as photos, a favourite toy, chewing gum, fiddle toys, craft). Keep it somewhere handy and explore it when you feel like self-harming.
 
 Who is at risk of self-harm?
 
 People of all ages self-harm, but young people are more at risk. According to the 2015 Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, around one in ten Australian teens have self-harmed. It is more common among girls than boys, and usually starts around the ages of 12 to 14 years, just after the onset of puberty. 
 
 Those who are at increased risk of self-harm include young people:
 
 aged 15–19
 
 with a mental health condition or personality disorder
 
 from Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander backgrounds
 
 in immigration detention or juvenile justice facilities
 
 in out-of-home care
 
 who live in rural and remote areas
 
 who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI).
 
 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people (aged 15–24) are five times more likely to self-harm than non-Indigenous young people.
 
 Why do people self-harm?
 
 There are many reasons why people self-harm. Even for one person the motivation can vary. Some people do it as a way of expressing their distress, taking back control or escaping from situations they find troubling. Others may find it makes them ‘feel’ something when they are numb and devoid of all feelings. Some people find self-harm gives them a sense of relief. 
 
 Whatever the reason, self-harm is normally a sign that a person is feeling intense emotional pain and distress.
 
 For young people, many stressful things (stressors) happen all at once. Not only are they dealing with changes to their bodies, they are trying to juggle demands they didn’t have when they were younger (such as study, work, relationships, being more independent and having more responsibility).
 
 Stressors that may increase the risk of self-harm include:
 
 family breakdown or conflict
 
 relationship difficulties
 
 knowing others who self-harm 
 
 having a family history of self-harm
 
 being bullied
 
 school or work problems
 
 alcohol and drug abuse
 
 past trauma, neglect or abuse.
 
 Personal factors that may increase someone’s risk of self-harm include:
 
 a previous history of self-harm
 
 experiencing aggression or violence
 
 mental health conditions
 
 low self-esteem
 
 poor body image and self-hatred
 
 physical illness or disability
 
 impulsivity – acting without thinking 
 
 poor coping skills
 
 difficulties with problem solving.
 
 What are the risks of self-harm?
 
 Although self-harm may bring relief in the short-term, it doesn’t help the person address the reasons they are doing it in the first place. Unless the problems that are causing the self-harming behaviour are addressed, people will continue to use it as a way to cope. 
 
 Unfortunately, self-harm can be dangerous – it can lead to serious injury and even accidental death. It can also lead to a higher risk of developing physical and mental health issues, substance misuse and unemployment.
 
 Although most people who self-harm don’t want to die, their behaviour can become more frequent and addictive as they seek out methods to deal with overwhelming emotions. Some people who self-harm have feelings of shame, self-loathing and helplessness and may have suicidal thoughts. Many people who attempt suicide have a history of self-harm.",,
1725,1,"Depression
 
 We all have times when we feel down, but depression is about more than feeling sad or fed up for a few days. Depression causes a low mood that lasts a long time and affects your daily life.
 
 *Last updated: 8 July 2021
 
 It can range from mild to severe. Mild depression can make you feel low and as though everything is harder to do. Severe depression can lead to feeling hopeless and, in some cases, suicidal.
 
 Depression is very common. In any given week in England, three in every 100 people will experience depression. Even more – eight in every 100 – will experience mixed depression and anxiety.
 
 What are the symptoms of depression?
 
 Depression affects people in different ways. Most people feel sad or hopeless and there are a range of other symptoms.
 
 Depression can affect your mind, body and behaviour.
 
 You might feel:
 
 sad, upset or tearful
 
 guilty or worthless
 
 restless or irritable
 
 empty and numb
 
 lacking in self-confidence and self-esteem
 
 unable to enjoy things that usually bring you pleasure
 
 helpless or hopeless
 
 anxious or worried
 
 suicidal or want to hurt yourself.
 
 Physical symptoms can include:
 
 tiredness and lack of energy
 
 moving or speaking more slowly
 
 sleep problems: finding it hard to get to sleep or waking up very early
 
 changes in your weight or appetite
 
 constipation
 
 no sex drive and/or sexual problems
 
 unexplained aches and pains.
 
 You might behave differently. You may:
 
 avoid other people, even your close friends
 
 find it hard to function at work, college or school
 
 find it difficult to make decisions or think clearly
 
 be unable to concentrate or remember things.
 
 Some people experience psychosis during a severe episode of depression. This means you may see or hear things that aren’t there or believe things that aren’t true.
 
 Different types of depression
 
 Your doctor may diagnose you with depression and say that it’s mild, moderate or severe depending on your symptoms and how severe they are. Or you may be diagnosed with a specific type of depression, such as:
 
 dysthymia – mild depression that lasts for several years
 
 seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – depression that comes and goes in a seasonal pattern
 
 postnatal depression – depression that many parents experience after having a baby. Some people experience antenatal depression during pregnancy.
 
 What causes depression?
 
 Depression is a complex condition. There are different factors that can lead to depression, including:
 
 genetics – if you have a close relative with depression, you’re more likely to experience depression yourself
 
 physical health problems
 
 childhood experiences such as abuse, neglect or bereavement
 
 stressful life events such as unemployment, the end of a relationship, or being bullied or assaulted.
 
 Getting support
 
 The first step to getting support is to speak to your GP.
 
 Common treatment for depression involves a combination of self-help, talking therapies and medication. The right treatment for you will depend on the type of depression you have and how severe it is.
 
 Self-help resources
 
 Your GP may offer you self-help resources. These are often available quite quickly and may be enough to help you feel better without trying other options. They include self-help books, online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or group exercise classes – there is evidence that exercise can help depression.
 
 The NHS website has more information about self-help, including links to books, apps and online forums.
 
 Talking therapies
 
 Talking therapies involve speaking in confidence to a trained professional about your feelings and worries. There are many different talking therapies that are recommended for depression, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy, psychotherapy and counselling. Your GP can advise you about which one you may find most helpful.
 
 Medication
 
 Another option is to take antidepressants. You can take them on their own or while having talking therapy.
 
 There are several different types of antidepressants and you can talk to your GP about which one might suit you best. If one doesn’t work, you may be prescribed another. You usually need to take them for one or two weeks before you start to feel the benefit.
 
 Read more about antidepressants on the NHS website.
 
 Ways you can look after yourself
 
 If you’re depressed, there are steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery. These steps can help if you’ve been depressed in the past and want to stay well.
 
 Talk about how you’re feeling. Talking to someone you trust, or finding peer support, can help you feel better and less alone.
 
 Eat well. A healthy diet can lift your mood and maintain your mental health.
 
 Stay physically active. Exercise may feel like the last thing you want to do, but it can ease the symptoms of depression. Research suggests it may be as effective as antidepressants in helping you feel better.
 
 Spend time in nature. Research shows that being in nature can make us feel happier, feel our lives are more worthwhile, and reduce our levels of depression
 
 Avoid cigarettes and alcohol. They may feel like they’re helping at first, but they make things worse in the long run.
 
 Try talking therapy to stay well. NICE guidelines recommend CBT or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy if you’ve been depressed in the past.",,
1746,1,"Postnatal depression
 
 Postnatal depression is a type of depression many people experience after having a baby. It’s not the same as the ‘baby blues’: it needs treatment so you can recover.
 
 * Last updated 28 June 2021
 
 Having a baby is a huge life event. It’s normal to experience a range of powerful emotions while you’re pregnant and after giving birth: excitement, joy, anxiety. You may also feel depressed. It’s not a sign of weakness or anything to feel guilty about. With support and treatment, you can get better.
 
 While most people have heard of postnatal depression, it’s also possible to experience antenatal depression while you’re pregnant. Some people experience both. The term ‘perinatal depression’ covers depression any time from getting pregnant to around a year after giving birth.
 
 This page covers postnatal depression, but the symptoms and treatment for antenatal or perinatal depression are the same.
 
 What is postnatal depression?
 
 The ‘baby blues’ is a brief period of feeling low, emotional and tearful after giving birth. It doesn’t last for more than two weeks of giving birth.
 
 If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression. It can start any time in the year after giving birth, and may begin gradually or suddenly. It can range from mild to severe.
 
 What are the symptoms?
 
 The symptoms of postnatal depression are similar to the symptoms of depression. They include:
 
 feeling sad or low
 
 being unable to enjoy things that normally bring you pleasure
 
 tiredness or loss in energy
 
 poor concentration or attention span
 
 low self-esteem and self-confidence
 
 disturbed sleep, even when your baby is asleep
 
 changes in appetite.
 
 You may feel detached from your baby or partner. You may even have thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby. It can be very frightening to have thoughts of harming your baby, but remember this doesn’t mean you’re actually going to hurt them. The sooner you can talk to someone about your thoughts and feelings – a friend, relative, doctor or midwife, for instance – the sooner you can get the help you need.
 
 What causes postnatal depression?
 
 There are many reasons why someone can develop postnatal depression. These include:
 
 previous mental health problems
 
 hormonal changes during and after pregnancy
 
 your circumstances: for example, a lack of social support, stressful living conditions, losing your job, bereavement
 
 childhood experiences such as abuse, neglect or trauma. These may make it hard for you to relate to others, including your baby, or doubt your own parenting skills
 
 domestic violence or other abuse
 
 low self-esteem.
 
 For many people, a combination of factors causes postnatal depression.
 
 If you’ve experienced mental health problems in the past, tell your GP, health visitor and/or midwife. They can support you during and after pregnancy.
 
 Getting support
 
 Being depressed doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent or that you’re going mad. It also doesn’t mean your baby will be taken away from you: this only happens in very exceptional circumstances.
 
 If you have symptoms of postnatal depression, speak to your GP, health visitor and/or midwife. It’s never too late to seek help: you can feel better even if you’ve had symptoms for a long time.
 
 Different help is available depending on how severe your symptoms are.
 
 Talking therapy
 
 You could be offered a self-help course or talking therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). You can refer yourself for talking therapy.
 
 CBT can help you see how the ways you think and behave may be making you feel depressed. For example, you may have unrealistic expectations about being a parent and feel you should never make a mistake. CBT can help you see these thoughts are unhelpful, and help you find a different way to think about parenthood.
 
 Medication
 
 Antidepressants can help if your depression is severe or if talking therapy hasn’t helped. If you’re breastfeeding, your GP can recommend one that’s safe to take.
 
 Specialist services
 
 Specialist services are available if you need more support. These include:
 
 perinatal mental health services with specialist nurses and doctors who can help you get the right support
 
 community mental health teams (CMHTs). They can help if there aren’t any perinatal mental health services in your area
 
 mother and baby units (MBUs). These are psychiatric wards in hospitals that can give you treatment and support as well as help you care for your baby. You’ll have your own bedroom with a cot for your baby.
 
 Ways you can help yourself
 
 Our page on depression has ideas on ways to look after yourself. As well as these, try to build a support network so you can meet friends and other new parents for a chat. Accept offers of help: don’t feel you have to do everything yourself.
 
 Tommy’s has information about planning ahead for after the birth with practical tips on some of the practical and emotional stresses you may experience.
 
 What is postnatal psychosis?
 
 Postnatal psychosis is a rare but serious illness. You may experience symptoms such as hearing or seeing things that aren’t there, believing things that aren’t true, mood swings, feeling confused and behaving in a way that is out of characters. Symptoms usually start suddenly, often within hours or days of giving birth.
 
 Postnatal psychosis (also known as postpartum psychosis) should be treated as a medical emergency. If you or your partner think you may have postnatal psychosis, seek medical help immediately from your GP, A&E or crisis team if you have one.",,
1751,0,"Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)
 
 Learn all about Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and seasonal changes in mood. 
 
 Last updated 30 October 2020
 
 What is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)?  
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes in a seasonal pattern.1 
 
 SAD makes you feel unhappy, anxious, tired, and irritable. It leaves you disinclined to socialise, and it undermines your ability to concentrate — all symptoms typical of depression.  
 
 Do seasons affect everyone’s mood?  
 
 There can be seasonal variations in everyone’s mental health. We know that things that are known to be good for our mental health such as exercising and spending time in green and blue spaces are harder to do when the days are short and nights are long. December is also a time when some of us may tend to eat and drink too much, run up debts, and then sometimes feel bad about these afterwards. 
 
 Some people might experience Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) with symptoms of depression that come and go in a seasonal pattern (and are usually more intense in the lower light months). SAD appears to result from changes in the length of day, although more than lost sunlight may be involved. 
 
 How can sunlight affect our moods?  
 
 Our bodies’ rhythms cycle in 24-hour intervals — including sleeping and waking, the release of certain hormones, and the highs and lows of body temperature. This rhythm is essentially under the control of our genes, but it can adjust to environmental cues, notably changes in the light/dark cycle.  
 
 Our brain's master clock uses these environmental cues of light and darkness to better align our internal rhythm to that of the world around us. Light and dark cues can cause bodily changes, which can in turn affect our hormones and impact our sleeping and eating habits, and our mood. 
 
 Read more about this in our sleep report
 
 What can we do to protect our mental health in darker months? 
 
 If you have been feeling depressed, it is important to speak with your GP or care provider for more detail and to discuss which treatment may be most appropriate for you. 
 
 There are also some steps you can take that may help alleviate some of the symptoms or even prevent seasonal changes in your mood:
 
 Light, especially natural light, can have a huge effect on your overall mood. You should spend some time each day outside in the natural light as well as open your curtains to let as much of it in as possible. Avoid sitting in dark or dimly-lit rooms, and use lamps & mirrors to brighten up anywhere that is particularly dark.  
 
 Exercise and spending time in green spaces are helpful for everyone’s mental health. Not only does regular exercise release chemicals such as endorphins, it can boost your self-esteem and help you concentrate, sleep and feel better. 
 
 We may find that we are not alone; people are there to help and so many are facing similar challenges. Mental health matters on every day of the year. ",,
1752,0,"Self-harm
 
 Self-harm is when someone intentionally hurts or injures themselves. For some, self-harm can represent a way of coping with or expressing feelings and emotions that are overwhelming or overpowering.
 
 Self-harm can refer to a range of behaviours and because of this, estimates of how common it is can vary. In 2014, 6.4% of English adults aged 16-74 reported having self-harmed at some point in their lives1.
 
 What is self-harm?
 
 Self-harm can refer to any behaviour where someone intentionally causes harm to themselves. It can be any behaviour, minor or high-risk, which causes injury or harm.
 
 Why do people self-harm?
 
 Self-harm behaviours may start as a way to relieve the pressure of distressing thoughts or feelings which are overwhelming2.
 
 It is common to occasionally experience emotions that are overwhelming. During these times many people use strategies such as talking to friends and family to manage these feelings. However, for others, these feelings may build up and they may turn the pressure in on themselves and use their bodies to release feelings of anger, guilt, or hopelessness.
 
 While the triggers or reasons behind self-harm will vary across individuals, some people say that difficulties at home, problems with friends or partners, bullying, mental health problems such as anxiety or depression, traumatic experiences, worries about money, and low self-esteem can all be contributing factors3,4.
 
 While self-harm can affect people of any age and background, rates may be higher among particular groups such as: young women, those in receipt of benefits, people who are unemployed or economically inactive, and those who live on their own1.
 
 Mental health problems may also be associated with self-harm behaviours. In 2017, 25.5% of 11 to 16-year olds in England who had a mental health problem said that they had self-harmed or attempted suicide at some point, compared to 3% of those without a mental health problem5. While self-harm has been linked to a higher risk of suicide, it is important to note that many people who self-harm do not want to end their lives1,2.
 
 Getting Support
 
 If you, or someone you know, has harmed themselves it is important to seek immediate care from the appropriate source (e.g. calling 999, 111, GP, A&E, or urgent care).
 
 If you are worried about self-harm behaviour, or have thoughts about self-harming, it is important to speak with a GP or other health professional, who can help you find the support you need.
 
 One common type of support for self-harm is psychological therapy. This can involve working through thoughts and feelings with a psychologist or other mental health professional in regular sessions over a set period of time. Psychological therapies like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can help teach strategies for recognising and coping with overwhelming or distressing thoughts and preventing further episodes of self-harm2.
 
 Further information about the process of being assessed for, and receiving support for self-harm is available on the NHS Choices website.",,
1759,0,"Suicide
 
 Thousands of people in the UK end their lives by suicide each year.
 
 Date last updated: 11 September 2019 
 
 Every year, around 800 000 people die by suicide globally.1 In the UK in 2018, there were 6,507 deaths by suicide (a rate of 11.2 deaths per 100,000 people).2
 
 Rates vary across the nations of Great Britain, with the highest rate in 2018 observed in Scotland (16.1 deaths per 100,000 people), followed by Wales (12.8 deaths per 100,000 people) and England (10.3 deaths per 100,000 people). Overall, men accounted for three-quarters of UK deaths by suicide in 2018.2 
 
 Suicide and suicide attempts can have lasting effects on individuals and their social networks and communities. The causes of suicide are many, and it is important to understand the psychological processes that underlie suicidal thoughts, and the factors that can lead to feelings of hopelessness or despair.3  
 
 In recognition of this, the 2019 theme for World Mental Health Day (as set by the World Federation for Mental Health) is “Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention”.  
 
 Risk factors  
 
 Suicide behaviours are complex, there is no single explanation of why people die by suicide. Social, psychological, and cultural factors can all interact to lead a person to suicidal thoughts or behaviour. For many people, an attempt may occur after a long period of suicidal thoughts or feelings, while in other cases, it may be more impulsive. 
 
 Several risk factors commonly act together to increase vulnerability to suicidal behaviour. The World Health Organisation has classified these into the different groups below:1  
 
 Societal
 
 difficulties accessing or receiving care
 
 access to means of suicide
 
 inappropriate media reporting
 
 stigma associated with mental health, substance abuse or suicidal behaviour which prevents people from seeking help 
 
 Community
 
 poverty
 
 experiences of trauma or abuse
 
 experiences of disaster, war, or conflict
 
 experiences of discrimination
 
 Relationships
 
 isolation and lack of social support
 
 relationship breakdown
 
 loss or conflict 
 
 Individual
 
 previous suicide attempts
 
 self-harm behaviours
 
 mental ill-health
 
 drug and alcohol misuse
 
 financial loss
 
 chronic pain
 
 family history of suicide 
 
 Protective factors
 
 Protective factors are those that can help to reduce vulnerability to suicidal behaviour. The consideration of how best to support and enhance people’s access to protective factors is an important part of preventing suicide. Some examples of protective factors include:4-5 
 
 Societal
 
 the ability to easily access effective mental health support and treatment when needed
 
 Community
 
 being in full-time employment
 
 having supportive school environments for children and young people 
 
 Relationships
 
 having strong and supportive social connections (such as positive relationships with family, friends, partners etc.) 
 
 Individual
 
 problem-solving skills and coping skills that help people to manage in difficult circumstances
 
 feeling hopeful or optimistic toward the future even in times of stress 
 
 Suicide, mental health and self-harm 
 
 People with a diagnosed mental health problem have been found to be at a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour.6-8 Self-harm behaviour has also been found to be a risk factor. While many people who engage in self-harming behaviour do not wish to die, there is research to suggest that individuals who self-harm are at an increased risk of attempting or completing suicide.9-10 
 
 Suicide prevention 
 
 A whole-system approach is needed for suicide prevention and work can be done at each of the “levels of prevention” to address the risk and protective factors for suicide.1 Local government, primary care, health and criminal justice services, voluntary organisations and local people affected by suicide all have a role to play. Suicide prevention can also be part of larger projects that address the wider determinants of health and wellbeing (i.e. the ways in which our environment and society can affect our health). 
 
 The National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England has identified several areas for action for suicide prevention.11-12 These include: 
 
 Reducing risk of suicide in high-risk groups (such as young men, people with a history of self-harm, people in contact with the criminal justice system) 
 
 Improving mental health for all and using tailored approaches to mental health support to help reach specific groups (such as children and young people, minority ethnic groups, the LGBT+ community and people with chronic health conditions)  
 
 Reducing access to means of suicide 
 
 Providing better information and support for those bereaved or affected by suicide 
 
 Supporting the media in delivering sensitive approaches to suicide and suicidal behaviour  
 
 Supporting more research, data collection and monitoring
 
 Each of us can help by paying attention to the wellbeing of people in our community such as friends, colleagues, and indeed anyone who you may be worried about. A simple 'how are you' can open the conversation. Listening and being open and understanding can help those at risk by letting them know it is okay for them to share.
 
 The isolation often felt by those experiencing suicidal thoughts or recovering from a suicide attempt can be reinforced by judgement or stigma in which their behaviour is viewed as manipulative or selfish. Showing care and respect for the people behind the behaviour, can help people to share their feelings and access the support they need.13  
 
 It can often feel difficult to start these conversations. Samaritans has tips on how to be a good listener.14 Further information on ways to support someone with suicidal thoughts is available from Rethink Mental Illness.13

1775,1,"Types of depression
 
 There are different types of depressive disorders. Symptoms can range from relatively minor (but still disabling) through to very severe, so it's helpful to be aware of the range of conditions and their specific symptoms.
 
 Major depression
 
 Major depression is sometimes called major depressive disorder, clinical depression, unipolar depression or simply 'depression'. It involves low mood and/or loss of interest and pleasure in usual activities, as well as other symptoms. The symptoms are experienced most days and last for at least two weeks. Symptoms of depression interfere with all areas of a person's life, including work and social relationships. Depression can be described as mild, moderate or severe; melancholic or psychotic (see below).
 
 Melancholia
 
 This is the term used to describe a severe form of depression where many of the physical symptoms of depression are present. One of the major changes is that the person starts to move more slowly. They're also more likely to have a depressed mood that is characterised by complete loss of pleasure in everything, or almost everything.
 
 Psychotic depression
 
 Sometimes people with a depressive disorder can lose touch with reality and experience psychosis. This can involve hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) or delusions (false beliefs that aren't shared by others), such as believing they are bad or evil, or that they're being watched or followed. They can also be paranoid, feeling as though everyone is against them or that they are the cause of illness or bad events occurring around them.
 
 Antenatal and postnatal depression
 
 Women are at an increased risk of depression during pregnancy (known as the antenatal or prenatal period) and in the year following childbirth (known as the postnatal period). You may also come across the term 'perinatal', which describes the period covered by pregnancy and the first year after the baby's birth.
 
 The causes of depression at this time can be complex and are often the result of a combination of factors. In the days immediately following birth, many women experience the 'baby blues' which is a common condition related to hormonal changes and affects up to 80 per cent of women. The 'baby blues', or general stress adjusting to pregnancy and/or a new baby, are common experiences, but are different from depression. Depression is longer lasting and can affect not only the mother, but her relationship with her baby, the child's development, the mother's relationship with her partner and with other members of the family.
 
 Almost 10 per cent of women will experience depression during pregnancy. This increases to 16 per cent in the first three months after having a baby.
 
 Bipolar disorder
 
 Bipolar disorder used to be known as 'manic depression' because the person experiences periods of depression and periods of mania, with periods of normal mood in between.
 
 Mania is like the opposite of depression and can vary in intensity – symptoms include feeling great, having lots of energy, having racing thoughts and little need for sleep, talking quickly, having difficulty focusing on tasks, and feeling frustrated and irritable. This is not just a fleeting experience. Sometimes the person loses touch with reality and has episodes of psychosis. Experiencing psychosis involves hallucinations (seeing or hearing something that is not there) or having delusions (e.g. the person believing he or she has superpowers).
 
 Bipolar disorder seems to be most closely linked to family history. Stress and conflict can trigger episodes for people with this condition and it's not uncommon for bipolar disorder to be misdiagnosed as depression, alcohol or drug abuse, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or schizophrenia.
 
 Diagnosis depends on the person having had an episode of mania and, unless observed, this can be hard to pick. It is not uncommon for people to go for years before receiving an accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder. If you're experiencing highs and lows, it's helpful to make this clear to your doctor or treating health professional. Bipolar disorder affects approximately 2 per cent of the population.
 
 Cyclothymic disorder
 
 Cyclothymic disorder is often described as a milder form of bipolar disorder. The person experiences chronic fluctuating moods over at least two years, involving periods of hypomania (a mild to moderate level of mania) and periods of depressive symptoms, with very short periods (no more than two months) of normality between. The duration of the symptoms are shorter, less severe and not as regular, and therefore don't fit the criteria of bipolar disorder or major depression.
 
 Dysthymic disorder
 
 The symptoms of dysthymia are similar to those of major depression but are less severe. However, in the case of dysthymia, symptoms last longer. A person has to have this milder depression for more than two years to be diagnosed with dysthymia.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
 
 SAD is a mood disorder that has a seasonal pattern. The cause of the disorder is unclear, but it's thought to be related to the variation in light exposure in different seasons. It's characterised by mood disturbances (either periods of depression or mania) that begin and end in a particular season. Depression which starts in winter and subsides when the season ends is the most common. It's usually diagnosed after the person has had the same symptoms during winter for a couple of years. People with SAD depression are more likely to experience a lack of energy, sleep too much, overeat, gain weight and crave for carbohydrates. SAD is very rare in Australia and more likely to be found in countries with shorter days and longer periods of darkness, such as in the cold climate areas of the Northern Hemisphere.
 
 Remember, depression is treatable and effective treatments are available. The earlier you seek support, the better.

1778,1,"People often keep it a secret, but the urge to self-harm isn’t uncommon, especially in adolescents and young adults. Many overcome it with treatment.
 
 Whether a person has recently started hurting themself or has been doing it for a while, there is an opportunity to improve health and reduce behaviors. Talking to a doctor or a trusted friend or family member is the first step towards understanding your behavior and finding relief.
 
 What Is Self-Harm?
 
 Self-harm or self-injury means hurting yourself on purpose. One common method is cutting with a sharp object. But any time someone deliberately hurts themself is classified as self-harm. Some people feel an impulse to cause burns, pull out hair or pick at wounds to prevent healing. Extreme injuries can result in broken bones.
 
 Hurting yourself—or thinking about hurting yourself—is a sign of emotional distress. These uncomfortable emotions may grow more intense if a person continues to use self-harm as a coping mechanism. Learning other ways to tolerate the mental pain will make you stronger in the long term.
 
 Self-harm also causes feelings of shame. The scars caused by frequent cutting or burning can be permanent. Drinking alcohol or doing drugs while hurting yourself increases the risk of a more severe injury than intended. And it takes time and energy away from other things you value. Skipping classes to change bandages or avoiding social occasions to prevent people from seeing your scars is a sign that your habit is negatively affecting work and relationships.
 
 Why People Self-Harm
 
 Self-harm is not a mental illness, but a behavior that indicates a need for better coping skills. Several illnesses are associated with it, including borderline personality disorder, depression, eating disorders, anxiety or posttraumatic distress disorder.
 
 Self-harm occurs most often during the teenage and young adult years, though it can also happen later in life. Those at the most risk are people who have experienced trauma, neglect or abuse. For instance, if a person grew up in an unstable family, it might have become a coping mechanism. If a person binge drinks or uses illicit drugs, they are at greater risk of self-injury, because alcohol and drugs lower self-control.
 
 The urge to hurt yourself may start with overwhelming anger, frustration or pain. When a person is not sure how to deal with emotions, or learned as a child to hide emotions, self-harm may feel like a release. Sometimes, injuring yourself stimulates the body’s endorphins or pain-killing hormones, thus raising their mood. Or if a person doesn’t feel many emotions, they might cause themself pain in order to feel something “real” to replace emotional numbness.
 
 Once a person injures themself, they may experience shame and guilt. If the shame leads to intense negative feelings, that person may hurt themself again. The behavior can thus become a dangerous cycle and a long-time habit. Some people even create rituals around it.
 
 Self-harm isn’t the same as attempting suicide. However, it is a symptom of emotional pain that should be taken seriously. If someone is hurting themself, they may be at an increased risk of feeling suicidal. It’s important to find treatment for the underlying emotions.
 
 Treatment And Coping
 
 There are effective treatments for self-harm that can allow a person to feel in control again. Psychotherapy is important to any treatment plan. Self-harm may feel necessary to manage emotions, so a person will need to learn new coping mechanisms.
 
 The first step in getting help is talking to a trusted adult, friend or medical professional who is familiar with the subject, ideally a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist will ask that person questions about their health, life history and any injurious behaviors in the past and present. This conversation, called a diagnostic interview, may last an hour or more. Doctors can’t use blood tests or physical exams to diagnose mental illness, so they rely on detailed information from the individual. The more information that person can give, the better the treatment plan will be.
 
 Depending on any underlying illness, a doctor may prescribe medication to help with difficult emotions. For someone with depression, for instance, an antidepressant may lessen harmful urges.
 
 A doctor will also recommend therapy to help a person learn new behaviors, if self-injury has become a habit. Several different kinds of therapy can help, depending on the diagnosis.
 
 Psychodynamic therapy focuses on exploring past experiences and emotions
 
 Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on recognizing negative thought patterns and increasing coping skills
 
 Dialectical behavioral therapy can help a person learn positive coping methods
 
 If your symptoms are overwhelming or severe, your doctor may recommend a short stay in a psychiatric hospital. A hospital offers a safe environment where you can focus your energy on treatment.
 
 What To Do When Someone Self-Harms
 
 Perhaps you have noticed a friend or family member with frequent bruises or bandages. If someone is wearing long sleeves and pants even in hot weather, they may be trying to hide injuries or scarring.
 
 Keep in mind that this is a behavior that might be part of a larger condition and there may be additional signs of emotional distress. They might make statements that sound hopeless or worthless, have poor impulse control, or have difficulty getting along with others.
 
 If you’re worried a family member or friend might be hurting themself, ask them how they're doing and be prepared to listen to the answer, even if it makes you uncomfortable. This may be a hard subject to understand. One of the best things is to tell them that while you may not fully understand, you’ll be there to help. Don’t dismiss emotions or try to turn it into a joke.
 
 Gently encourage someone to get treatment by stating that self-harm isn’t uncommon and doctors and therapists can help. If possible, offer to help find treatment. But don’t go on the offensive and don’t try to make the person promise to stop, as it takes more than willpower to quit.",,
1788,0,"Major Depressive Disorder with a Seasonal Pattern (formerly known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD) is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression in late fall and winter, alternating with periods of normal mood the rest of the year.
 
 Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health were the first to suggest this condition was a response to decreased light and experimented with the use of bright light to address the symptoms. Scientists have identified that the neurotransmitter serotonin may not be working optimally in many people who experience this disorder.
 
 The prevalence of this condition appears to vary with latitude, age and sex:
 
 Prevalence increases among people living in higher/northern latitudes.
 
 Younger persons are at higher risk.
 
 Women are more likely than men to experience this condition.
 
 Symptoms
 
 This disorder’s most common presentation is of an atypical depression. With classic depression, people tend to lose weight and sleep less. This condition is the kind of atypical depression often seen in bipolar disorder—people tend to gain weight and sleep more.
 
 Although not everyone experiences all the following symptoms, the classic characteristics of Major Depressive Disorder with a Seasonal Pattern include:
 
 Hypersomnia (or oversleeping)
 
 Daytime fatigue
 
 Overeating
 
 Weight gain
 
 Craving carbohydrates
 
 Many people may experience other symptoms as well, including:
 
 Decreased sexual interest
 
 Lethargy
 
 Hopelessness
 
 Suicidal thoughts
 
 Lack of interest in usual activities and decreased socialization
 
 Diagnosis
 
 The key to an accurate diagnose of this condition is recognizing its pattern. Symptoms usually begin in October/November and subside in March/April. Some people begin to experience a “slump” as early as August, while others remain well until January. Regardless of the time of onset, most people don’t feel fully “back to normal” until early May.
 
 For a diagnosis to be made, this pattern of onset and remission must have occurred during at least a two-year period, without the occurrence of any non-seasonal episodes during that same period.
 
 This means you will not receive this diagnosis the first time you experience symptoms. If you believe you may have a seasonal depressive pattern, it’s important to pay attention to the pattern. Track your symptoms, noting when they begin and when they subside. This self-awareness can help. Mental health professionals will ask you about your observations and also your family history since mood disorders tend to run in families.
 
 Treatment
 
 As with most depressive disorders, the best treatment includes a combination of antidepressant medications, cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise. Unlike other depressive disorders, this condition can also be treated with light therapy. Light therapy consists of regular, daily exposure to a “light box,” which artificially simulates high-intensity sunlight. Be aware that ordinary indoor light is not sufficient to treat this condition
 
 Some primary care doctors have experience treating this disorder. Remember that this condition is a subset of major depression. If your primary care doctor prescribes you an antidepressant, orders you a light box and sends you to a social worker—and you have trouble the following year—consider seeking consultation from a psychiatrist. Treatment planning needs to match the severity of the condition for each individual.
 
 Planning Ahead
 
 If you know you have a seasonal pattern, ask yourself “How can I plan for this?” Because this disorder has a specific pattern, those who experience it can prepare for its arrival in the following ways, for example:
 
 Exercise more toward the end of summer
 
 Get into therapy around September
 
 Start your lightbox in October
 
 Plan a vacation to a sunny spot in January
 
 Some people may require treatment only during the time of the year in which they experience symptoms, or they may need treatment that begins before symptoms are most severe. Others may choose year-round treatment.
 
",,
1789,0,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Peripartum Onset (also known as postpartum depression) is different than a temporary mood disturbance after childbirth. Up to 6% of women will experience a major depressive episode during pregnancy or in the first year following delivery. It is also estimated that 50% of all MDD episodes actually begin prior to delivery or postpartum. For this reason, all episodes are referred to collectively as “peripartum.”
 
 Any woman can experience postpartum depression and it has no relationship to a woman's capacity to be a good mother. With treatment, she can feel better.
 
 Symptoms
 
 Postpartum depression can present different symptoms, depending on the person. But common symptoms include:
 
 Extreme difficulty in day-to-day functioning
 
 Feelings of guilt, anxiety and fear
 
 Loss of pleasure in life
 
 Insomnia
 
 Bouts of crying
 
 Thoughts of hurting oneself or the infant
 
 Psychotic symptoms in the peripartum timeframe are less common after childbirth and are characterized by seeing things that don't exist, confusion, rapid mood swings and thoughts of harming oneself or the infant. These symptoms only occur in about 1 of every 1,000 births. Women who have bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder are at increased risk of having psychotic symptoms, but they can also occur in women with no prior history.
 
 Causes
 
 Previous depressive episodes and/or a family history of depression, lack of social support, anxiety, marriage or money problems, stress and substance use disorders are risk factors for MDD with Peripartum Onset. The risk of developing symptoms of depression has also been associated with being a stay-at-home mother and unwanted pregnancy.
 
 Women who have experienced one episode of post-partum depression have an increased chance of experiencing it again. Preparing with your doctor for onset can make a significant difference in many cases.
 
 Diagnosis
 
 One of the criteria used to diagnose depression is appetite change. However, appetite may not be suitable for the diagnosis of depression in the perinatal (the period around birth: five months before and one month after) period.
 
 Dramatic hormone changes—like those that happen during the perinatal period—can replicate symptoms of depression. During pregnancy, a woman's estrogen and progesterone levels increase. In the first 24 hours after childbirth, these hormone levels abruptly return to normal. Thyroid hormones may also decrease after childbirth. A blood test can determine if thyroid/hormone levels are truly to blame.
 
 Treatment
 
 The key to recovery is seek help as soon as symptoms are recognized. Treatment plans vary by individual and include options such as individual, family or group psychotherapy, medications.
 
 Resources
 
 Studies suggest that women who experience postpartum depression have often had earlier episodes of depression that were not diagnosed or treated. If you have experienced an episode of depression and are planning to become pregnant, you can reduce your risk and improve your outcomes. Talk with your obstetrician or primary care provider about whether they can help you—if not, a mental health professional can be of help. Local academic departments of psychiatry also often have resources in this field. Here is one example at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

 Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.
 
 More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply ""snap out"" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.

 Symptoms
 Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include:
 
 Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness
 Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters
 Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports
 Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much
 Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort
 Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain
 Anxiety, agitation or restlessness
 Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements
 Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame
 Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things
 Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide
 Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches
 For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.
 
 Depression symptoms in children and teens
 Common signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences.
 
 In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight.
 In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction.
 Depression symptoms in older adults
 Depression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as:
 
 Memory difficulties or personality changes
 Physical aches or pain
 Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex — not caused by a medical condition or medication
 Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things
 Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men
 When to see a doctor
 If you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can. If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.
 
 When to get emergency help
 If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.
 
 Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts:
 
 Call your doctor or mental health professional.
 Call a suicide hotline number — in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). Use that same number and press ""1"" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line.
 Reach out to a close friend or loved one.
 Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.
 If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.

 Causes
 It's not known exactly what causes depression. As with many mental disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, such as:
 
 Biological differences. People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes.
 Brain chemistry. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression. Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment.
 Hormones. Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression. Hormone changes can result with pregnancy and during the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum) and from thyroid problems, menopause or a number of other conditions.
 Inherited traits. Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have this condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression.

 Risk factors
 Depression often begins in the teens, 20s or 30s, but it can happen at any age. More women than men are diagnosed with depression, but this may be due in part because women are more likely to seek treatment.
 
 Factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression include:
 
 Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical or pessimistic
 Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems
 Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide
 Being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or having variations in the development of genital organs that aren't clearly male or female (intersex) in an unsupportive situation
 History of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder, eating disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder
 Abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs
 Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain or heart disease
 Certain medications, such as some high blood pressure medications or sleeping pills (talk to your doctor before stopping any medication)
 Complications
 Depression is a serious disorder that can take a terrible toll on you and your family. Depression often gets worse if it isn't treated, resulting in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your life.
 
 Examples of complications associated with depression include:
 
 Excess weight or obesity, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes
 Pain or physical illness
 Alcohol or drug misuse
 Anxiety, panic disorder or social phobia
 Family conflicts, relationship difficulties, and work or school problems
 Social isolation
 Suicidal feelings, suicide attempts or suicide
 Self-mutilation, such as cutting
 Premature death from medical conditions

 'Situational' Depression
 Atypical Depression
 Treatment Resistant Depression
 It's normal to feel down once in a while, but if you're sad most of the time and it affects your daily life, you may have clinical depression. It's a condition you can treat with medicine, talking to a therapist, and changes to your lifestyle.
 
 There are many different types of depression. Events in your life cause some, and chemical changes in your brain cause others.
 
 Whatever the cause, your first step is to let your doctor know how you're feeling. They may refer you to a mental health specialist to help figure out the type of depression you have. This diagnosis is important in deciding the right treatment for you.
 
 Major Depression
 You may hear your doctor call this ""major depressive disorder."" You might have this type if you feel depressed most of the time for most days of the week.
 
 Some other symptoms you might have are:
 
 Loss of interest or pleasure in your activities
 Weight loss or gain
 Trouble getting to sleep or feeling sleepy during the day
 Feeling restless and agitated, or else very sluggish and slowed down physically or mentally
 Being tired and without energy
 Feeling worthless or guilty
 Trouble concentrating or making decisions
 Thoughts of suicide
 
 Your doctor might diagnose you with major depression if you have five or more of these symptoms on most days for 2 weeks or longer. At least one of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or loss of interest in activities.
 
 Major depression looks differently in different people. Depending on how your depression makes you feel, it could be:
 
 Anxious distress. You feel tense and restless most days. You have trouble concentrating because you’re worried that something awful could happen, and you feel like you might lose control of yourself.
 
 
 Melancholy. You feel intensely sad and lose interest in the activities you used to enjoy. You feel bad even when good things happen. You might also:
 
 Feel particularly down in the mornings
 Lose weight
 Sleep poorly
 Have suicidal thoughts
 If you have melancholic depression, your symptoms might be worst in the mornings when you first wake up. Consider having someone help you with your first tasks of the day. Make sure to eat regularly even if you don’t feel hungry.
 
 Agitated. You feel uneasy most of the time. You may also:
 
 Talk a lot
 Move for no reason, like fidgeting with your hands and pacing around the room
 Act impulsively
 Talk therapy can help. You'll meet with a mental health specialist who will help you find ways to manage your depression. Medications called antidepressants can also be useful.
 
 When therapy and medication aren't working, other options your doctor may suggest are:
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
 Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)
 ECT uses electrical pulses, TMS uses a special kind of magnet, and VNS uses an implanted device. All are design to stimulate certain areas of brain activity. This helps the parts of your brain that control your mood work better.
 
 Persistent Depressive Disorder
 If you have depression that lasts for 2 years or longer, it's called persistent depressive disorder. This term is used to describe two conditions previously known as dysthymia (low-grade persistent depression) and chronic major depression.
 
 You may have symptoms such as:
 
 Change in your appetite (not eating enough or overeating)
 Sleeping too much or too little
 Lack of energy, or fatigue
 Low self-esteem
 Trouble concentrating or making decisions
 Feeling hopeless
 You may be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.
 
 Bipolar Disorder
 Someone with bipolar disorder, which is also sometimes called ""manic depression,"" has mood episodes that range from extremes of high energy with an ""up"" mood to low ""depressive"" periods.
 
 When you're in the low phase, you'll have the symptoms of major depression.
 
 Medication can help bring your mood swings under control. Whether you're in a high or a low period, your doctor may suggest a mood stabilizer, such as lithium.
 
 The FDA has approved three medicines to treat the depressed phase:
 
 Seroquel
 Latuda
 Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination
 Doctors sometimes prescribe other drugs ""off label"" for bipolar depression, such as the anticonvulsant lamotrigine or the atypical antipsychotic Vraylar.
 
 Traditional antidepressants are not always recommended as first-line treatments for bipolar depression because there's no proof from studies that these drugs are more helpful than a placebo (a sugar pill) in treating depression in people with bipolar disorder. Also, for a small percentage of people with bipolar disorder, some traditional antidepressants may increase the risk of causing a ""high"" phase of illness, or speeding up the frequency of having more episodes over time.
 
 Psychotherapy can also help support you and your family.
 
 Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)
 Seasonal affective disorder is a period of major depression that most often happens during the winter months, when the days grow short and you get less and less sunlight. It typically goes away in the spring and summer.
 
 If you have SAD, antidepressants can help. So can light therapy. You'll need to sit in front of a special bright light box for about 15-30 minutes each day.
 
 Psychotic Depression
 People with psychotic depression have the symptoms of major depression along with ""psychotic"" symptoms, such as:
 
 Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there)
 Delusions (false beliefs)
 Paranoia (wrongly believing that others are trying to harm you)
 A combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs can treat psychotic depression. ECT may also be an option.
 
 Peripartum (Postpartum) Depression
 Women who have major depression in the weeks and months after childbirth may have peripartum depression. Approximately 1 in 10 men also experience depression in the peripartum period. Antidepressant drugs can help similarly to treating major depression that is unrelated to childbirth. 
 
 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)
 Women with PMDD have depression and other symptoms at the start of their period.
 
 Besides feeling depressed, you may also have:
 
 Mood swings
 Irritability
 Anxiety
 Trouble concentrating
 Fatigue
 Change in appetite or sleep habits
 Feelings of being overwhelmed
 Antidepressant medication or sometimes oral contraceptives can treat PMDD.
 
 'Situational' Depression
 This isn't a technical term in psychiatry. But you can have a depressed mood when you're having trouble managing a stressful event in your life, such as a death in your family, a divorce, or losing your job. Your doctor may call this ""stress response syndrome.""
 
 Psychotherapy can often help you get through a period of depression that's related to a stressful situation.
 
 Atypical Depression
 This type is different from the persistent sadness of typical depression. It is considered to be a ""specifier"" that describes a pattern of depressive symptoms. If you have atypical depression, a positive event can temporarily improve your mood.
 
 Other symptoms of atypical depression include:
 
 Increased appetite
 Sleeping more than usual
 Feeling of heaviness in your arms and legs
 Oversensitive to criticism
 Antidepressants can help. Your doctor may suggest a type called an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) as the first-line treatment.
 
 They may also sometimes recommend an older type of antidepressant called an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), which is a class of antidepressants that has been well-studied in treating atypical depression.
 
 Treatment Resistant Depression
 About 1/3 of people treated for depression try several treatment methods without success. If that’s you, you might have treatment resistant depression. There are many reasons your depression might be treatment resistant. For example, you might have other conditions that make your depression difficult to treat.
 
 If you’re diagnosed with treatment resistant depression, your doctor might recommend some less conventional treatment options. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes helpful in this situation.

1924,1,"Diagnosis
 Your doctor may determine a diagnosis of depression based on:
 
 Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. In some cases, depression may be linked to an underlying physical health problem.
 Lab tests. For example, your doctor may do a blood test called a complete blood count or test your thyroid to make sure it's functioning properly.
 Psychiatric evaluation. Your mental health professional asks about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions.
 DSM-5. Your mental health professional may use the criteria for depression listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.
 Types of depression
 Symptoms caused by major depression can vary from person to person. To clarify the type of depression you have, your doctor may add one or more specifiers. A specifier means that you have depression with specific features, such as:
 
 Anxious distress — depression with unusual restlessness or worry about possible events or loss of control
 Mixed features — simultaneous depression and mania, which includes elevated self-esteem, talking too much and increased energy
 Melancholic features — severe depression with lack of response to something that used to bring pleasure and associated with early morning awakening, worsened mood in the morning, major changes in appetite, and feelings of guilt, agitation or sluggishness
 Atypical features — depression that includes the ability to temporarily be cheered by happy events, increased appetite, excessive need for sleep, sensitivity to rejection, and a heavy feeling in the arms or legs
 Psychotic features — depression accompanied by delusions or hallucinations, which may involve personal inadequacy or other negative themes
 Catatonia — depression that includes motor activity that involves either uncontrollable and purposeless movement or fixed and inflexible posture
 Peripartum onset — depression that occurs during pregnancy or in the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum)
 Seasonal pattern — depression related to changes in seasons and reduced exposure to sunlight
 Other disorders that cause depression symptoms
 Several other disorders, such as those below, include depression as a symptom. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis, so you can get appropriate treatment.
 
 Bipolar I and II disorders. These mood disorders include mood swings that range from highs (mania) to lows (depression). It's sometimes difficult to distinguish between bipolar disorder and depression.
 Cyclothymic disorder. Cyclothymic (sy-kloe-THIE-mik) disorder involves highs and lows that are milder than those of bipolar disorder.
 Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. This mood disorder in children includes chronic and severe irritability and anger with frequent extreme temper outbursts. This disorder typically develops into depressive disorder or anxiety disorder during the teen years or adulthood.
 Persistent depressive disorder. Sometimes called dysthymia (dis-THIE-me-uh), this is a less severe but more chronic form of depression. While it's usually not disabling, persistent depressive disorder can prevent you from functioning normally in your daily routine and from living life to its fullest.
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder. This involves depression symptoms associated with hormone changes that begin a week before and improve within a few days after the onset of your period, and are minimal or gone after completion of your period.
 Other depression disorders. This includes depression that's caused by the use of recreational drugs, some prescribed medications or another medical condition.

 Treatment
 Medications and psychotherapy are effective for most people with depression. Your primary care doctor or psychiatrist can prescribe medications to relieve symptoms. However, many people with depression also benefit from seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional.
 
 If you have severe depression, you may need a hospital stay, or you may need to participate in an outpatient treatment program until your symptoms improve.
 
 Here's a closer look at depression treatment options.
 
 Medications
 Many types of antidepressants are available, including those below. Be sure to discuss possible major side effects with your doctor or pharmacist.
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Doctors often start by prescribing an SSRI. These drugs are considered safer and generally cause fewer bothersome side effects than other types of antidepressants. SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), sertraline (Zoloft) and vilazodone (Viibryd).
 Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Examples of SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and levomilnacipran (Fetzima).
 Atypical antidepressants. These medications don't fit neatly into any of the other antidepressant categories. They include bupropion (Wellbutrin XL, Wellbutrin SR, Aplenzin, Forfivo XL), mirtazapine (Remeron), nefazodone, trazodone and vortioxetine (Trintellix).
 Tricyclic antidepressants. These drugs — such as imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), amitriptyline, doxepin, trimipramine (Surmontil), desipramine (Norpramin) and protriptyline (Vivactil) — can be very effective, but tend to cause more-severe side effects than newer antidepressants. So tricyclics generally aren't prescribed unless you've tried an SSRI first without improvement.
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAOIs — such as tranylcypromine (Parnate), phenelzine (Nardil) and isocarboxazid (Marplan) — may be prescribed, typically when other drugs haven't worked, because they can have serious side effects. Using MAOIs requires a strict diet because of dangerous (or even deadly) interactions with foods ― such as certain cheeses, pickles and wines ― and some medications and herbal supplements. Selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that sticks on the skin as a patch, may cause fewer side effects than other MAOIs do. These medications can't be combined with SSRIs.
 Other medications. Other medications may be added to an antidepressant to enhance antidepressant effects. Your doctor may recommend combining two antidepressants or adding medications such as mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. Anti-anxiety and stimulant medications also may be added for short-term use.
 Finding the right medication
 If a family member has responded well to an antidepressant, it may be one that could help you. Or you may need to try several medications or a combination of medications before you find one that works. This requires patience, as some medications need several weeks or longer to take full effect and for side effects to ease as your body adjusts.
 
 Inherited traits play a role in how antidepressants affect you. In some cases, where available, results of genetic tests (done by a blood test or cheek swab) may offer clues about how your body may respond to a particular antidepressant. However, other variables besides genetics can affect your response to medication.
 
 Risks of abruptly stopping medication
 Don't stop taking an antidepressant without talking to your doctor first. Antidepressants aren't considered addictive, but sometimes physical dependence (which is different from addiction) can occur.
 
 Stopping treatment abruptly or missing several doses can cause withdrawal-like symptoms, and quitting suddenly may cause a sudden worsening of depression. Work with your doctor to gradually and safely decrease your dose.
 
 Antidepressants and pregnancy
 If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, some antidepressants may pose an increased health risk to your unborn child or nursing child. Talk with your doctor if you become pregnant or you're planning to become pregnant.
 
 Antidepressants and increased suicide risk
 Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants to carry a black box warning, the strictest warning for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under age 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed.
 
 Anyone taking an antidepressant should be watched closely for worsening depression or unusual behavior, especially when starting a new medication or with a change in dosage. If you or someone you know has suicidal thoughts when taking an antidepressant, immediately contact a doctor or get emergency help.
 
 Keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood.
 
 Psychotherapy
 Psychotherapy is a general term for treating depression by talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional. Psychotherapy is also known as talk therapy or psychological therapy.
 
 Different types of psychotherapy can be effective for depression, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy. Your mental health professional may also recommend other types of therapies. Psychotherapy can help you:
 
 Adjust to a crisis or other current difficulty
 Identify negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones
 Explore relationships and experiences, and develop positive interactions with others
 Find better ways to cope and solve problems
 Identify issues that contribute to your depression and change behaviors that make it worse
 Regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life and help ease depression symptoms, such as hopelessness and anger
 Learn to set realistic goals for your life
 Develop the ability to tolerate and accept distress using healthier behaviors
 Alternate formats for therapy
 Formats for depression therapy as an alternative to face-to-face office sessions are available and may be an effective option for some people. Therapy can be provided, for example, as a computer program, by online sessions, or using videos or workbooks. Programs can be guided by a therapist or be partially or totally independent.
 
 Before you choose one of these options, discuss these formats with your therapist to determine if they may be helpful for you. Also, ask your therapist if he or she can recommend a trusted source or program. Some may not be covered by your insurance and not all developers and online therapists have the proper credentials or training.
 
 Smartphones and tablets that offer mobile health apps, such as support and general education about depression, are not a substitute for seeing your doctor or therapist.
 
 Hospital and residential treatment
 In some people, depression is so severe that a hospital stay is needed. This may be necessary if you can't care for yourself properly or when you're in immediate danger of harming yourself or someone else. Psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe until your mood improves.
 
 Partial hospitalization or day treatment programs also may help some people. These programs provide the outpatient support and counseling needed to get symptoms under control.
 
 Other treatment options
 For some people, other procedures, sometimes called brain stimulation therapies, may be suggested:
 
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In ECT, electrical currents are passed through the brain to impact the function and effect of neurotransmitters in your brain to relieve depression. ECT is usually used for people who don't get better with medications, can't take antidepressants for health reasons or are at high risk of suicide.
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS may be an option for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. During TMS, a treatment coil placed against your scalp sends brief magnetic pulses to stimulate nerve cells in your brain that are involved in mood regulation and depression.

 Lifestyle and home remedies
 Depression generally isn't a disorder that you can treat on your own. But in addition to professional treatment, these self-care steps can help:
 
 Stick to your treatment plan. Don't skip psychotherapy sessions or appointments. Even if you're feeling well, don't skip your medications. If you stop, depression symptoms may come back, and you could also experience withdrawal-like symptoms. Recognize that it will take time to feel better.
 Learn about depression. Education about your condition can empower you and motivate you to stick to your treatment plan. Encourage your family to learn about depression to help them understand and support you.
 Pay attention to warning signs. Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your depression symptoms. Make a plan so that you know what to do if your symptoms get worse. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. Ask relatives or friends to help watch for warning signs.
 Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. It may seem like alcohol or drugs lessen depression symptoms, but in the long run they generally worsen symptoms and make depression harder to treat. Talk with your doctor or therapist if you need help with alcohol or substance use.
 Take care of yourself. Eat healthy, be physically active and get plenty of sleep. Consider walking, jogging, swimming, gardening or another activity that you enjoy. Sleeping well is important for both your physical and mental well-being. If you're having trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor about what you can do.

 Alternative medicine
 Alternative medicine is the use of a nonconventional approach instead of conventional medicine. Complementary medicine is a nonconventional approach used along with conventional medicine — sometimes called integrative medicine.
 
 Make sure you understand the risks as well as possible benefits if you pursue alternative or complementary therapy. Don't replace conventional medical treatment or psychotherapy with alternative medicine. When it comes to depression, alternative treatments aren't a substitute for medical care.
 
 Supplements
 Examples of supplements that are sometimes used for depression include:
 
 St. John's wort. Although this herbal supplement isn't approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat depression in the U.S., it may be helpful for mild or moderate depression. But if you choose to use it, be careful — St. John's wort can interfere with a number of medications, such as heart drugs, blood-thinning drugs, birth control pills, chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS medications and drugs to prevent organ rejection after a transplant. Also, avoid taking St. John's wort while taking antidepressants because the combination can cause serious side effects.
 SAMe. Pronounced ""sam-E,"" this dietary supplement is a synthetic form of a chemical that occurs naturally in the body. The name is short for S-adenosylmethionine (es-uh-den-o-sul-muh-THIE-o-neen). SAMe isn't approved by the FDA to treat depression in the U.S. It may be helpful, but more research is needed. SAMe may trigger mania in people with bipolar disorder.
 Omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats are found in cold-water fish, flaxseed, flax oil, walnuts and some other foods. Omega-3 supplements are being studied as a possible treatment for depression. While considered generally safe, in high doses, omega-3 supplements may interact with other medications. More research is needed to determine if eating foods with omega-3 fatty acids can help relieve depression.
 Nutritional and dietary products aren't monitored by the FDA the same way medications are. You can't always be certain of what you're getting and whether it's safe. Also, because some herbal and dietary supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any supplements.
 
 Mind-body connections
 Integrative medicine practitioners believe the mind and body must be in harmony for you to stay healthy. Examples of mind-body techniques that may be helpful for depression include:
 
 Acupuncture
 Relaxation techniques such as yoga or tai chi
 Meditation
 Guided imagery
 Massage therapy
 Music or art therapy
 Spirituality
 Aerobic exercise
 Relying solely on these therapies is generally not enough to treat depression. They may be helpful when used in addition to medication and psychotherapy.

 Coping and support
 Talk with your doctor or therapist about improving your coping skills, and try these tips:
 
 Simplify your life. Cut back on obligations when possible, and set reasonable goals for yourself. Give yourself permission to do less when you feel down.
 Write in a journal. Journaling, as part of your treatment, may improve mood by allowing you to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions.
 Read reputable self-help books and websites. Your doctor or therapist may be able to recommend books or websites to read.
 Locate helpful groups. Many organizations, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, offer education, support groups, counseling and other resources to help with depression. Employee assistance programs and religious groups also may offer help for mental health concerns.
 Don't become isolated. Try to participate in social activities, and get together with family or friends regularly. Support groups for people with depression can help you connect to others facing similar challenges and share experiences.
 Learn ways to relax and manage your stress. Examples include meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga and tai chi.
 Structure your time. Plan your day. You may find it helps to make a list of daily tasks, use sticky notes as reminders or use a planner to stay organized.
 Don't make important decisions when you're down. Avoid decision-making when you're feeling depressed, since you may not be thinking clearly.
 Preparing for your appointment
 You may see your primary care doctor, or your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.
 
 What you can do
 Before your appointment, make a list of:
 
 Any symptoms you've had, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment
 Key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes
 All medications, vitamins or other supplements that you're taking, including dosages
 Questions to ask your doctor or mental health professional
 Take a family member or friend along, if possible, to help you remember all of the information provided during the appointment.
 
 Some basic questions to ask your doctor include:
 
 Is depression the most likely cause of my symptoms?
 What are other possible causes for my symptoms?
 What kinds of tests will I need?
 What treatment is likely to work best for me?
 What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?
 I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?
 Are there any restrictions that I need to follow?
 Should I see a psychiatrist or other mental health professional?
 What are the main side effects of the medications you're recommending?
 Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?
 Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can have? What websites do you recommend?
 Don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.
 
 What to expect from your doctor
 Your doctor will likely ask you a number of questions. Be ready to answer them to reserve time to go over any points you want to focus on. Your doctor may ask:
 
 When did you or your loved ones first notice your symptoms of depression?
 How long have you felt depressed? Do you generally always feel down, or does your mood fluctuate?
 Does your mood ever swing from feeling down to feeling intensely happy (euphoric) and full of energy?
 Do you ever have suicidal thoughts when you're feeling down?
 Do your symptoms interfere with your daily life or relationships?
 Do you have any blood relatives with depression or another mood disorder?
 What other mental or physical health conditions do you have?
 Do you drink alcohol or use recreational drugs?
 How much do you sleep at night? Does it change over time?
 What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?
 What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?

 What is major depressive disorder?
 Sadness is a natural part of the human experience. People may feel sad or depressed when a loved one passes away or when they’re going through a life challenge, such as a divorce or serious illness.
 
 These feelings are normally short-lived. When someone experiences persistent and intense feelings of sadness for extended periods of time, then they may have a mood disorder such as major depressive disorder (MDD).
 
 MDD, also referred to as clinical depression, is a significant medical condition that can affect many areas of your life. It impacts mood and behavior as well as various physical functions, such as appetite and sleep.
 
 MDD is one of the most common mental health conditions in the United States. Data suggests that more than 7 percent of U.S. adults experienced a major depressive episode in 2017.
 
 Some people with MDD never seek treatment. However, most people with the disorder can learn to cope and function with treatment. Medications, psychotherapy, and other methods can effectively treat people with MDD and help them manage their symptoms.
 
 
 What are the symptoms of major depressive disorder?
 Your doctor or a mental health professional can make a diagnosis of major depressive disorder based on your symptoms, feelings, and behaviors.
 
 Typically, you’ll be asked certain questions or given a questionnaire so they can better determine if you have MDD or another diagnosis.
 
 To be diagnosed with MDD, you need to meet the symptom criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). This manual helps medical professionals diagnose mental health conditions.
 
 According to its criteria:
 
 you must experience a change in your previous functioning
 symptoms must occur for a period of 2 or more weeks
 at least one symptom is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure
 You must also experience 5 or more of the following symptoms in the 2-week period:
 
 You feel sad or irritable most of the day, nearly every day.
 You’re less interested in most activities you once enjoyed.
 You suddenly lose or gain weight or have a change in appetite.
 You have trouble falling asleep or want to sleep more than usual.
 You experience feelings of restlessness.
 You feel unusually tired and have a lack of energy.
 You feel worthless or guilty, often about things that wouldn’t normally make you feel that way.
 You have difficulty concentrating, thinking, or making decisions.
 You think about harming yourself or suicide.

 What causes major depressive disorder?
 The exact cause of MDD isn’t known. However, there are several factors that can increase your risk of developing the condition.
 
 A combination of genes and stress can affect brain chemistry and reduce the ability to maintain mood stability.
 
 Changes in the balance of hormones might also contribute to the development of MDD.
 
 MDD may also be triggered by:
 
 alcohol or drug use
 certain medical conditions, such as cancer or hypothyroidism
 particular types of medications, including steroids
 abuse during childhood

 How is major depressive disorder treated?
 MDD is often treated with medication and psychotherapy. Some lifestyle adjustments can also help ease certain symptoms.
 
 People who have severe MDD or who have thoughts of harming themselves may need to stay in a hospital during treatment. Some might also need to take part in an outpatient treatment program until symptoms improve.
 
 Medications
 Primary care providers often start treatment for MDD by prescribing antidepressant medications.
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
 SSRIs are a frequently prescribed type of antidepressant. SSRIs work by helping inhibit the breakdown of serotonin in the brain, resulting in higher amounts of this neurotransmitter.
 
 Serotonin is a brain chemical that’s believed to be responsible for mood. It may help improve mood and produce healthy sleeping patterns.
 
 People with MDD are often thought to have low levels of serotonin. An SSRI can relieve symptoms of MDD by increasing the amount of available serotonin in the brain.
 
 SSRIs include well-known drugs such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and citalopram (Celexa). They have a relatively low incidence of side effects that most people tolerate well.
 
 Similar to SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are another type of antidepressant often prescribed. These affect serotonin and norepinephrine.
 
 Other medications
 Tricyclic antidepressants and medications known as atypical antidepressants, such as bupropion (Wellbutrin), may be used when other drugs haven’t helped.
 
 These drugs can cause several side effects, including weight gain and sleepiness. As with any medication, benefits and side effects need to be weighed carefully with your doctor.
 
 Some medications used to treat MDD aren’t safe while pregnant or breastfeeding. Make sure you speak to a healthcare provider if you become pregnant, you’re planning to become pregnant, or you’re breastfeeding.
 
 Psychotherapy
 Psychotherapy, also known as psychological therapy or talk therapy, can be an effective treatment for people with MDD. It involves meeting with a therapist on a regular basis to talk about your condition and related issues.
 
 Psychotherapy can help you:
 
 adjust to a crisis or other stressful event
 replace negative beliefs and behaviors with positive, healthy ones
 improve your communication skills
 find better ways to cope with challenges and solve problems
 increase your self-esteem
 regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life
 Your healthcare provider may also recommend other types of therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy. If you don’t already have a healthcare provider, the Healthline FindCare tool can help you find a physician in your area.
 
 Another possible treatment is group therapy, which allows you to share your feelings with people who can relate to what you’re going through.
 
 Online therapy options
 Read our review of the best online therapy options to find the right fit for you.
 
 Lifestyle changes
 In addition to taking medications and participating in therapy, you can help improve MDD symptoms by making some changes to your daily habits.
 
 Eat right
 Nutritious foods benefit your mind and body, and while no foods can cure depression, certain healthy food choices can benefit your mental well-being.
 
 Consider eating foods:
 
 containing omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon
 rich in B vitamins, such as beans and whole grains
 with magnesium, which is found in nuts, seeds, and yogurt
 Avoid alcohol and certain processed foods
 It’s beneficial to avoid alcohol, as it’s a nervous system depressant that can make your symptoms worse.
 
 Also, certain refined, processed, and deep-fried foods contain omega-6 fatty acids, which may contribute to MDD.
 
 Get plenty of exercise
 Although MDD can make you feel very tired, it’s important to be physically active. Exercising, especially outdoors and in moderate sunlight, can boost your mood and make you feel better.
 
 Sleep well
 It’s vital to get enough sleep per night, which can vary from person to person but typically ranges between 7–9 hours.
 
 People with depression often have trouble with sleeping. Speak to a doctor if you’re having trouble sleeping or oversleeping.
 
 What is the outlook for someone with major depressive disorder?
 While someone with MDD can feel hopeless at times, it’s important to remember that the disorder can be treated successfully. There is hope.
 
 To improve your outlook, it’s critical to stick with your treatment plan. Don’t miss therapy sessions or follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider.
 
 You should also never stop taking your medications unless you’re instructed to do so by your therapist or healthcare provider.
 
 On days when you feel particularly depressed despite treatment, it can be helpful to call a local crisis or mental health service, or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Resources are available.
 
 A friendly, supportive voice could be just what you need to get you through a difficult time.
 
 Suicidal thoughts
 If you start taking antidepressants and have suicidal thoughts, call your doctor or 911 right away. Although it’s a rare occurrence, some MDD medications can cause suicidal thoughts in people who have just started treatment. Talk to your doctor about concerns you may have about taking medications that pose this risk.

1926,1,"Overview
 Persistent depressive disorder, also called dysthymia (dis-THIE-me-uh), is a continuous long-term (chronic) form of depression. You may lose interest in normal daily activities, feel hopeless, lack productivity, and have low self-esteem and an overall feeling of inadequacy. These feelings last for years and may significantly interfere with your relationships, school, work and daily activities.
 
 If you have persistent depressive disorder, you may find it hard to be upbeat even on happy occasions — you may be described as having a gloomy personality, constantly complaining or incapable of having fun. Though persistent depressive disorder is not as severe as major depression, your current depressed mood may be mild, moderate or severe.
 
 Because of the chronic nature of persistent depressive disorder, coping with depression symptoms can be challenging, but a combination of talk therapy (psychotherapy) and medication can be effective in treating this condition.

 Symptoms
 Persistent depressive disorder symptoms usually come and go over a period of years, and their intensity can change over time. But typically symptoms don't disappear for more than two months at a time. In addition, major depression episodes may occur before or during persistent depressive disorder — this is sometimes called double depression.
 
 Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder can cause significant impairment and may include:
 
 Loss of interest in daily activities
 Sadness, emptiness or feeling down
 Hopelessness
 Tiredness and lack of energy
 Low self-esteem, self-criticism or feeling incapable
 Trouble concentrating and trouble making decisions
 Irritability or excessive anger
 Decreased activity, effectiveness and productivity
 Avoidance of social activities
 Feelings of guilt and worries over the past
 Poor appetite or overeating
 Sleep problems
 In children, symptoms of persistent depressive disorder may include depressed mood and irritability.
 
 When to see a doctor
 Because these feelings have gone on for such a long time, you may think they'll always be part of your life. But if you have any symptoms of persistent depressive disorder, seek medical help.
 
 Talk to your primary care doctor about your symptoms. Or seek help directly from a mental health professional. If you're reluctant to see a mental health professional, reach out to someone else who may be able to help guide you to treatment, whether it's a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.
 
 If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.

 Causes
 The exact cause of persistent depressive disorder isn't known. As with major depression, it may involve more than one cause, such as:
 
 Biological differences. People with persistent depressive disorder may have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but they may eventually help pinpoint causes.
 Brain chemistry. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression. Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment.
 Inherited traits. Persistent depressive disorder appears to be more common in people whose blood relatives also have the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression.
 Life events. As with major depression, traumatic events such as the loss of a loved one, financial problems or a high level of stress can trigger persistent depressive disorder in some people
 Risk factors
 Persistent depressive disorder often begins early — in childhood, the teen years or young adult life — and is chronic. Certain factors appear to increase the risk of developing or triggering persistent depressive disorder, including:
 
 Having a first-degree relative with major depressive disorder or other depressive disorders
 Traumatic or stressful life events, such as the loss of a loved one or financial problems
 Personality traits that include negativity, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical or pessimistic
 History of other mental health disorders, such as a personality disorder
 Complications
 Conditions that may be linked with persistent depressive disorder include:
 
 Reduced quality of life
 Major depression, anxiety disorders and other mood disorders
 Substance abuse
 Relationship difficulties and family conflicts
 School and work problems and decreased productivity
 Chronic pain and general medical illnesses
 Suicidal thoughts or behavior
 Personality disorders or other mental health disorders
 Prevention
 There's no sure way to prevent persistent depressive disorder. Because it often starts in childhood or during the teenage years, identifying children at risk of the condition may help them get early treatment.
 
 Strategies that may help ward off symptoms include the following:
 
 Take steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and to boost your self-esteem.
 Reach out to family and friends, especially in times of crisis, to help you weather rough spells.
 Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent symptoms from worsening.
 Consider getting long-term maintenance treatment to help prevent a relapse of symptoms.

 Symptoms & causes
 Diagnosis & treatment
",,
1927,1,"Diagnosis
 If your doctor suspects you have persistent depressive disorder, exams and tests may include:
 
 Physical exam. The doctor may do a physical exam and ask in-depth questions about your health to determine what may be causing your depression. In some cases, it may be linked to an underlying physical health problem.
 Lab tests. Your doctor may order lab tests to rule out other medical conditions that may cause depressive symptoms. For example, your doctor may order a blood test to find out if your thyroid is underactive (hypothyroidism).
 Psychological evaluation. This includes discussing your thoughts, feelings and behavior and it may include a questionnaire to help pinpoint a diagnosis. This evaluation can help determine if you have persistent depressive disorder or another condition that can affect mood, such as major depression, bipolar disorder or seasonal affective disorder.
 For a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder, the main indication for an adult differs somewhat from that of a child:
 
 For an adult, depressed mood occurs most of the day for two or more years
 For a child, depressed mood or irritability occurs most of the day for at least one year
 Symptoms caused by persistent depressive disorder can vary from person to person. When persistent depressive disorder starts before age 21, it's called early onset; if it starts at age 21 or older, it's called late onset.
 
 Treatment
 The two main treatments for persistent depressive disorder are medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy). The treatment approach your doctor recommends depends on factors such as:
 
 Severity of your symptoms
 Your desire to address emotional or situational issues affecting your life
 Your personal preferences
 Previous treatment methods
 Your ability to tolerate medications
 Other emotional problems you may have
 Psychotherapy may be the first recommendation for children and adolescents with persistent depressive disorder, but that depends on the individual. Sometimes antidepressants are also needed.
 
 Medications
 The types of antidepressants most commonly used to treat persistent depressive disorder include:
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
 Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
 Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
 Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about possible side effects.
 
 Finding the right medication
 You may need to try several medications or a combination before you find one that works. This requires patience, as some medications take several weeks or longer for full effect and for side effects to ease as your body adjusts.
 
 Don't stop taking an antidepressant without talking to your doctor — your doctor can help you gradually and safely decrease your dose. Stopping treatment abruptly or missing several doses may cause withdrawal-like symptoms, and quitting suddenly may cause a sudden worsening of depression.
 
 When you have persistent depressive disorder, you may need to take antidepressants long term to keep symptoms under control
 
 Antidepressants and pregnancy
 If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, some antidepressants may pose an increased health risk to your unborn baby or nursing child. Talk to your doctor if you become pregnant or are planning on becoming pregnant.
 
 FDA alert on antidepressants
 Although antidepressants are generally safe when taken as directed, the FDA requires all antidepressants to carry a black box warning, the strictest warning for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teens and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed.
 
 Anyone taking an antidepressant should be watched closely for worsening depression or unusual behavior, especially when first beginning a new medication or with a change in dosage. If your teen has suicidal thoughts while taking an antidepressant, immediately contact your doctor or get emergency help.
 
 Keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood.
 
 Psychotherapy
 Psychotherapy is a general term for treating depression by talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional. Psychotherapy is also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling.
 
 Different types of psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, can be effective for persistent depressive disorder. You and your therapist can discuss which type of therapy is right for you, your goals for therapy and other issues, such as the length of treatment.
 
 Psychotherapy can help you:
 
 Adjust to a crisis or other current difficulty
 Identify issues that contribute to your depression and change behaviors that make it worse
 Identify negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones
 Find better ways to cope and solve problems
 Explore relationships and experiences, and develop positive interactions with others
 Regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life and help ease depression symptoms, such as hopelessness and anger
 Learn to set realistic goals for your life

 Lifestyle and home remedies
 Persistent depressive disorder generally isn't a condition that you can treat on your own. But, in addition to professional treatment, these self-care steps can help:
 
 Stick to your treatment plan. Don't skip psychotherapy sessions or appointments, and even if you're feeling well, don't skip your medications. Give yourself time to improve gradually.
 Learn about persistent depressive disorder. Education about your condition can empower you and motivate you to stick to your treatment plan. Encourage your family to learn about the disorder to help them understand and support you.
 Pay attention to warning signs. Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your symptoms. Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms get worse or return. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. Consider involving family members or friends to watch for warning signs.
 Take care of yourself. Eat healthy, be physically active and get plenty of sleep. Consider walking, jogging, swimming, gardening or another activity that you enjoy. Sleeping well is important for both your physical and mental well-being. If you're having trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor about what you can do.
 Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. It may seem like alcohol or drugs lessen depression-related symptoms, but in the long run they generally worsen depression and make it harder to treat. Talk with your doctor or therapist if you need help dealing with alcohol or drug use.
 Alternative medicine
 Make sure you understand the risks as well as possible benefits if you pursue alternative or complementary therapy. Avoid replacing conventional medical treatment or psychotherapy with alternative medicine. When it comes to depression, alternative treatments aren't a substitute for medical care.
 
 For example, the herbal supplement called St. John's wort is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat depression in the U.S., though it's available. It may help improve mild or moderate depression, but the overall evidence is not conclusive.
 
 St. John's wort can interfere with a number of medications, including blood-thinning drugs, birth control pills, chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS medications and drugs to prevent organ rejection after a transplant. Also, avoid taking St. John's wort while taking antidepressants because the combination can cause serious side effects.
 
 FDA doesn't monitor supplements
 Dietary supplements aren't approved and monitored by the FDA the same way medications are. You can't always be certain of what you're getting and whether it's safe. Also, because some herbal and other dietary supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions, talk to your healthcare provider before taking any supplements.
 
 Coping and support
 Persistent depressive disorder makes it hard to engage in behavior and activities that can help you feel better. In addition to the treatments recommended by your doctor or therapist, consider these tips:
 
 Focus on your goals. Dealing with persistent depressive disorder is an ongoing process. Set reasonable goals for yourself. Stay motivated by keeping your goals in mind. But give yourself permission to do less when you feel down.
 Simplify your life. Cut back on obligations when possible. Structure your time by planning your day. You may find it helps to make a list of daily tasks, use sticky notes as reminders or use a planner to stay organized.
 Write in a journal. Journaling as part of your treatment may improve mood by allowing you to express pain, anger, fear or other emotions.
 Read reputable self-help books and websites. Ask your doctor or therapist to recommend books or websites to read.
 Stay connected. Don't become isolated. Try to participate in social activities, and get together with family or friends regularly. Support groups for people with depression can help you connect with others facing similar challenges and share experiences.
 Learn ways to relax and manage your stress. Examples include meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga and tai chi.
 Don't make important decisions when you're down. Avoid decision-making when you're feeling depressed, since you may not be thinking clearly.
 Preparing for your appointment
 You may decide to schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor to talk about your concerns or you may decide to see a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, for evaluation.
 
 What you can do
 Prepare for your appointment by making a list of:
 
 Any symptoms you've had, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment
 Key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes
 All medications, vitamins, supplements or herbal preparations that you're taking, and the doses
 Questions to ask your doctor
 Taking a family member or friend along can help you remember something that you missed or forgot.
 
 Basic questions to ask your doctor may include:
 
 Why can't I get over this depression on my own?
 How do you treat this type of depression?
 Will talk therapy (psychotherapy) help?
 Are there medications that might help?
 How long will I need to take medication?
 What are some of the side effects of the medication you're recommending?
 How often will we meet?
 How long will treatment take?
 What can I do to help myself?
 Are there any brochures or other printed materials that I can have?
 What websites do you recommend?
 Don't hesitate to ask other questions during your appointment.
 
 What to expect from your doctor
 Your doctor may ask you several questions, such as:
 
 When did you first notice symptoms?
 How is your daily life affected by your symptoms?
 What other treatment have you had?
 What have you tried on your own to feel better?
 What things make you feel worse?
 Have any relatives had any type of depression or another mental illness?
 What do you hope to gain from treatment?

 Who Is at Risk for Major Depression?
 Are Women at Higher Risk for Major Depression?
 What Are the Signs of Major Depression in Men?
 What Triggers Major Depression?
 How Is Major Depression Diagnosed?
 How Is Major Depression Treated?
 Can Major Depression Be Prevented?
 A constant sense of hopelessness and despair is a sign you may have major depression, also known as clinical depression.
 
 With major depression, it may be difficult to work, study, sleep, eat, and enjoy friends and activities. Some people have clinical depression only once in their life, while others have it several times in a lifetime.
 
 Major depression can sometimes occur from one generation to the next in families, but often it may affect people with no family history of the illness.
 
 What Is Major or Clinical Depression?
 Most people feel sad or low at some point in their lives. But clinical depression is marked by a depressed mood most of the day, sometimes particularly in the morning, and a loss of interest in normal activities and relationships -- symptoms that are present every day for at least 2 weeks. In addition, according to the DSM-5 -- a manual used to diagnose mental health conditions -- you may have other symptoms with major depression. Those symptoms might include:
 
 Fatigue or loss of energy almost every day
 Feelings of worthlessness or guilt almost every day
 Impaired concentration, indecisiveness
 Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleeping) almost every day
 Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities nearly every day (called anhedonia, this symptom can be indicated by reports from significant others)
 Restlessness or feeling slowed down
 Recurring thoughts of death or suicide
 Significant weight loss or gain (a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month)
 
 Who Is at Risk for Major Depression?
 Major depression affects about 6.7% of the U.S. population over age 18, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Overall, between 20% and 25% of adults may suffer an episode of major depression at some point during their lifetime.
 
 Major depression also affects older adults, teens, and children, but frequently goes undiagnosed and untreated in these populations.
 
 
 Are Women at Higher Risk for Major Depression?
 Almost twice as many women as men have major or clinical depression; hormonal changes during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, miscarriage, and menopause, may increase the risk.
 
 Other factors that boost the risk of clinical depression in women who are biologically vulnerable to it include increased stress at home or at work, balancing family life with career, and caring for an aging parent. Raising a child alone will also increase the risk.
 
 SUGGESTED
 
 
 
 What Are the Signs of Major Depression in Men?
 Depression in men is significantly underreported. Men who suffer from clinical depression are less likely to seek help or even talk about their experience.
 
 Signs of depression in men may include irritability, anger, or drug and alcohol abuse (substance abuse can also be a cause of depression rather than the result of it). Suppressing negative feelings can result in violent behavior directed both inwardly and outwardly. It can also result in an increase in illness, suicide, and homicide.
 
 What Triggers Major Depression?
 Some common triggers or causes of major depression include:
 
 Loss of a loved one through death, divorce, or separation
 Social isolation or feelings of being deprived
 Major life changes -- moving, graduation, job change, retirement
 Personal conflicts in relationships, either with a significant other or a superior
 Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse
 How Is Major Depression Diagnosed?
 A health professional -- such as your primary care doctor or a psychiatrist -- will perform a thorough medical evaluation. You might receive a screening for depression at a regular doctor’s visit. The professional will ask about your personal and family psychiatric history and ask you questions that screen for the symptoms of major depression.
 
 
 There is no blood test, X-ray, or other laboratory test that can be used to diagnose major depression. However, your doctor may run blood tests to help detect any other medical problems that have symptoms similar to those of depression. For example, hypothyroidism can cause some of the same symptoms as depression, as can alcohol or drug use and abuse, some medications, and stroke.
 
 How Is Major Depression Treated?
 Major or clinical depression is a serious but treatable illness. Depending on the severity of symptoms, your primary care doctor or a psychiatrist may recommend treatment with an antidepressant medication. They may also suggest psychotherapy, or talk therapy, in which you address your emotional state.
 
 Sometimes, other medications are added to the antidepressant to boost its effectiveness. Certain medicines work better for some people. It may be necessary for your doctor to try different drugs at different doses to determine which medicine works best for you.
 
 There are other treatment options for clinical depression -- such as electroconvulsive therapy, also called ECT or shock therapy -- that can be used if drugs prove ineffective or symptoms are severe. Other treatments for depression that is difficult to treat include intranasal ketamine or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
 
 SUGGESTED
 
 
 
 Can Major Depression Be Prevented?
 Once you have had an episode of major depression, you are at high risk of having another. The best way to prevent another episode of depression is to be aware of the triggers or causes of major depression (see above) and to continue taking the prescribed medication to avoid relapse. It is also important to know what the symptoms of major depression are and to talk with your doctor early if you have any of these symptoms.",,
1929,0,"What does the term ""clinical depression"" mean?
 Answer From Daniel K. Hall-Flavin, M.D.
 Depression ranges in seriousness from mild, temporary episodes of sadness to severe, persistent depression. Clinical depression is the more-severe form of depression, also known as major depression or major depressive disorder. It isn't the same as depression caused by a loss, such as the death of a loved one, or a medical condition, such as a thyroid disorder.
 
 To diagnose clinical depression, many doctors use the symptom criteria for major depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.
 
 Signs and symptoms of clinical depression may include:
 
 Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness
 Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters
 Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports
 Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much
 Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort
 Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain
 Anxiety, agitation or restlessness
 Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements
 Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame
 Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things
 Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide
 Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches
 Symptoms are usually severe enough to cause noticeable problems in relationships with others or in day-to-day activities, such as work, school or social activities.
 
 Clinical depression can affect people of any age, including children. However, clinical depression symptoms, even if severe, usually improve with psychological counseling, antidepressant medications or a combination of the two.

 OVERVIEW
 What is persistent depressive disorder?
 Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is mild or moderate depression that doesn’t go away. A person with PDD has a sad, dark, or low mood and two or more other symptoms of depression. The symptoms last most of the day, on most days, over a long period of time.
 
 Healthcare providers used to call the condition dysthymia or dysthymic disorder.
 
 What’s the difference between depression and persistent depressive disorder?
 Persistent depressive disorder is a type of depression. It’s less severe than major depressive disorder — another type — but it’s ongoing. It’s defined as lasting at least two years in adults and at least one year in children and teens. During this time, symptoms can't be absent for more than two consecutive months to meet the criteria for PDD.
 
 How common is chronic depression?
 PDD can happen to anyone at any age. In fact, 3% or more of the U.S. population experiences it at some point in their lives.
 
 PDD is more common in women and in people who have relatives with the same condition.
 
 SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES
 What causes persistent depressive disorder?
 Scientists don’t fully understand what causes PDD. But it might be related to low levels of serotonin. Serotonin is a natural hormone that controls our emotions and feelings of well-being. It also influences other body functions.
 
 PDD may get triggered by a traumatic event in life. Examples include losing a job, having a loved one die, experiencing a crime or going through a breakup.
 
 What are the symptoms of PDD?
 The main symptom of PDD is a sad, low or dark mood. Other signs may include:
 
 Fatigue.
 Feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness or isolation.
 Lack of appetite or overeating.
 Lack of concentration.
 Limited energy.
 Low self-esteem.
 Trouble at work or school.
 Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much.
 Most people with PDD also have an episode of major depression at least once at some point, which is sometimes called “double depression.”
 
 DIAGNOSIS AND TESTS
 How is persistent depressive disorder diagnosed?
 If you think you have PDD, talk to a healthcare provider. There are no tests for chronic depression, so the diagnosis comes from discussions with a provider. The provider might ask:
 
 Do you feel sad a lot?
 Are there particular reasons you feel down?
 Do you have trouble sleeping?
 Do you have trouble concentrating?
 Are you taking any medications?
 How long have you had these symptoms?
 Are the symptoms there all the time, or do they come and go?
 Your healthcare provider may order blood or urine tests to rule out other causes. The healthcare provider also might refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist to talk about your symptoms. These providers are specially trained to discuss mental health.
 
 MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT
 How is persistent depressive disorder treated?
 The most effective treatment for PDD combines medications and talk therapy, or counseling.
 
 Antidepressants are prescription drugs that can relieve depression. There are many different kinds of medications for the treatment of depression. The most commonly used fall into two broad categories:
 
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
 Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
 You may need to take medication for a month or longer before you feel a difference. Make sure to continue taking the medication exactly as your healthcare provider prescribed. Even if you have side effects or feel much better, don’t stop without talking to your healthcare provider first.
 
 Counseling can also help manage PDD. One type of therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is often helpful for depression. A therapist or psychologist will help you examine your thoughts and emotions and how they affect your actions. CBT can help you unlearn negative thoughts and develop more positive thinking.
 
 PREVENTION
 Can I prevent persistent depressive disorder?
 Although you can’t prevent depression, you can do some things to make it less severe:
 
 Eat a well-balanced diet of nutritious foods.
 Exercise several times a week.
 Limit alcohol and avoid recreational drugs.
 Taking prescribed medications correctly and discussing any potential side effects with your healthcare providers.
 Watch for any changes in PDD and talk to your healthcare provider about them.
 OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
 What is the outlook for people with persistent depressive disorder?
 With medication, talk therapy and lifestyle changes, you can manage PDD and feel better. But some people have depressive symptoms throughout their lives.
 
 Most people with PDD will have one or more episodes of major depression. If depression gets worse, talk to your healthcare provider.
 
 When should I seek immediate care?
 If you think about hurting yourself or someone else, tell somebody right away. You can tell a healthcare provider, a friend or a family member.
 
 You can also contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:
 
 Call: 800.273.TALK (8255)
 Chat online: http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/.
 You’re not alone, and there’s always somebody who wants to help.
 
 LIVING WITH
 How can I cope with persistent depressive disorder?
 In addition to taking medication and going to therapy, consider doing things you enjoy, such as:
 
 Do something nice for someone else.
 Go to a movie, a show or a ballgame.
 Hang out with people who have positive attitudes.
 Paint, or try some arts and crafts.
 Spend time outside.
 Spend time with friends, in person or on the phone.
 Take a yoga class, learn to meditate, or walk with a friend.
 A note from Cleveland Clinic
 
 PDD can make you feel sad or down most of the day, most days, over a long period of time. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have depressive symptoms. Medication, counseling and healthy lifestyle choices can make you feel better. If you feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, seek help immediately. You’re not alone.",,

 Diagnosis
 Understanding depression
 Everyone goes through periods of deep sadness and grief. These feelings usually fade away within a few days or weeks, depending on the circumstances. But profound sadness that lasts more than two weeks and affects your ability to function may be a sign of depression.
 
 Some of the common symptoms of depression are:
 
 deep feelings of sadness
 dark moods
 feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness
 appetite changes
 sleep changes
 lack of energy
 inability to concentrate
 difficulty getting through your normal activities
 lack of interest in things you used to enjoy
 withdrawing from friends
 preoccupation with death or thoughts of self-harm
 Depression affects everyone differently, and you might only have some of these symptoms. You may also have other symptoms that aren’t listed here. Keep in mind that it’s also normal to have some of these symptoms from time to time without having depression.
 
 But if they start to impact your day-to-day life, they may be the result of depression.
 
 There are many types of depression. While they share some common symptoms, they also have some key differences.
 
 Here’s a look at nine types of depression and how they affect people.
 
 1. Major depression
 Major depression is also known as major depressive disorder, classic depression, or unipolar depression. It’s fairly common — about 16.2 million adults in the U.S. have experienced at least one major depressive episode.
 
 People with major depression experience symptoms most of the day, every day. Like many mental health conditions, it has little to do with what’s happening around you. You can have a loving family, tons of friends, and a dream job. You can have the kind of life that others envy and still have depression.
 
 Even if there’s no obvious reason for your depression, that doesn’t mean it’s not real or that you can simply tough it out.
 
 It’s a severe form of depression that causes symptoms such as:
 
 despondency, gloom, or grief
 difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much
 lack of energy and fatigue
 loss of appetite or overeating
 unexplained aches and pains
 loss of interest in formerly pleasurable activities
 lack of concentration, memory problems, and inability to make decisions
 feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness
 constant worry and anxiety
 thoughts of death, self-harm, or suicide
 These symptoms can last weeks or even months. Some people might have a single episode of major depression, while others experience it throughout their life. Regardless of how long its symptoms last, major depression can cause problems in your relationships and daily activities.
 
 2. Persistent depression
 Persistent depressive disorder is depression that lasts for two years or more. It’s also called dysthymia or chronic depression. Persistent depression might not feel as intense as major depression, but it can still strain relationships and make daily tasks difficult.
 
 Some symptoms of persistent depression include:
 
 deep sadness or hopelessness
 low self-esteem or feelings of inadequacy
 lack of interest in things you once enjoyed
 appetite changes
 changes to sleep patterns or low energy
 concentration and memory problems
 difficulty functioning at school or work
 inability to feel joy, even at happy occasions
 social withdrawal
 Though it’s a long-term type of depression, the severity of symptoms can become less intense for months at a time before worsening again. Some people also have episodes of major depression before or while they have persistent depressive disorder. This is called double depression.
 
 Persistent depression lasts for years at a time, so people with this type of depression may start to feel like their symptoms are just part of their normal outlook on life.
 
 
 3. Manic depression, or bipolar disorder
 Manic depression consists of periods of mania or hypomania, where you feel very happy, alternating with episodes of depression. Manic depression is an outdated name for bipolar disorder.
 
 In order to be diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, you have to experience an episode of mania that lasts for seven days, or less if hospitalization is required. You may experience a depressive episode before or following the manic episode.
 
 Depressive episodes have the same symptoms as major depression, including:
 
 feelings of sadness or emptiness
 lack of energy
 fatigue
 sleep problems
 trouble concentrating
 decreased activity
 loss of interest in formerly enjoyable activities
 suicidal thoughts
 Signs of a manic phase include:
 
 high energy
 reduced sleep
 irritability
 racing thoughts and speech
 grandiose thinking
 increased self-esteem and confidence
 unusual, risky, and self-destructive behavior
 feeling elated, “high,” or euphoric
 In severe cases, episodes can include hallucinations and delusions. Hypomania is a less severe form of mania. You can also have mixed episodes in which you have symptoms of both mania and depression.
 
 There are several types of bipolar disorder. Read more about them and how they’re diagnosed.
 
 4. Depressive psychosis
 Some people with major depression also go through periods of losing touch with reality. This is known as psychosis, which can involve hallucinations and delusions. Experiencing both of these together is known clinically as major depressive disorder with psychotic features. However, some providers still refer to this phenomenon as depressive psychosis or psychotic depression.
 
 Hallucinations are when you see, hear, smell, taste, or feel things that aren’t really there. An example of this would be hearing voices or seeing people who aren’t present. A delusion is a closely held belief that’s clearly false or doesn’t make sense. But to someone experiencing psychosis, all of these things are very real and true.
 
 Depression with psychosis can cause physical symptoms as well, including problems sitting still or slowed physical movements.

 5. Perinatal depression
 Perinatal depression, which is clinically known as major depressive disorder with peripartum onset, occurs during pregnancy or within four weeks of childbirth. It’s often called postpartum depression. But that term only applies to depression after giving birth. Perinatal depression can occur while you’re pregnant.
 
 Hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy and childbirth can trigger changes in the brain that lead to mood swings. The lack of sleep and physical discomfort that often accompanies pregnancy and having a newborn doesn’t help, either.
 
 Symptoms of perinatal depression can be as severe as those of major depression and include:
 
 sadness
 anxiety
 anger or rage
 exhaustion
 extreme worry about the baby‘s health and safety
 difficulty caring for yourself or the new baby
 thoughts of self-harm or harming the baby
 Women who lack support or have had depression before are at increased risk of developing perinatal depression, but it can happen to anyone.
 
 6. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). While PMS symptoms can be both physical and psychological, PMDD symptoms tend to be mostly psychological.
 
 These psychological symptoms are more severe than those associated with PMS. For example, some women might feel more emotional in the days leading up to their period. But someone with PMDD might experience a level of depression and sadness that gets in the way of day-to-day functions.
 
 Other possible symptoms of PMDD include:
 
 cramps, bloating, and breast tenderness
 headaches
 joint and muscle pain
 sadness and despair
 irritability and anger
 extreme mood swings
 food cravings or binge eating
 panic attacks or anxiety
 lack of energy
 trouble focusing
 sleep problems
 Similarly to perinatal depression, PMDD is believed to be related to hormonal changes. Its symptoms often begin just after ovulation and start to ease up once you get your period.
 
 Some women dismiss PMDD as just a bad case of PMS, but PMDD can become very severe and include thoughts of suicide.

 7. Seasonal depression
 Seasonal depression, also called seasonal affective disorder and clinically known as major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, is depression that’s related to certain seasons. For most people, it tends to happen during the winter months.
 
 Symptoms often begin in the fall, as days start to get shorter, and continue through the winter. They include:
 
 social withdrawal
 increased need for sleep
 weight gain
 daily feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or unworthiness
 Seasonal depression may get worse as the season progresses and can lead to suicidal thoughts. Once spring rolls around, symptoms tend to improve. This might be related to changes in your bodily rhythms in response to the increase in natural light.
 
 8. Situational depression
 Situational depression, clinically known as adjustment disorder with depressed mood, looks like major depression in many respects.
 
 But it’s brought on by specific events or situations, such as:
 
 the death of a loved one
 a serious illness or other life-threatening event
 going through divorce or child custody issues
 being in emotionally or physically abusive relationships
 being unemployed or facing serious financial difficulties
 facing extensive legal troubles
 Of course, it’s normal to feel sad and anxious during events like these — even to withdraw from others for a bit. But situational depression happens when these feelings start to feel out of proportion with the triggering event and interfere with your daily life.
 
 Situational depression symptoms tend to start within three months of the initial event and can include:
 
 frequent crying
 sadness and hopelessness
 anxiety
 appetite changes
 difficulty sleeping
 aches and pains
 lack of energy and fatigue
 inability to concentrate
 social withdrawal
 9. Atypical depression
 Atypical depression refers to depression that temporarily goes away in response to positive events. Your doctor might refer to it as major depressive disorder with atypical features.
 
 Despite its name, atypical depression isn’t unusual or rare. It also doesn’t mean that it’s more or less serious than other types of depression.
 
 Having atypical depression can be particularly challenging because you may not always “seem” depressed to others (or yourself). But it can also happen during an episode of major depression. It can occur with persistent depression as well.
 
 Other symptoms of atypical depression can include:
 
 increased appetite and weight gain
 disordered eating
 poor body image
 sleeping much more than usual
 insomnia
 heaviness in your arms or legs that lasts an hour or more a day
 feelings of rejection and sensitivity to criticism
 assorted aches and pains
 How do I know which type I have?
 If you think you might have any type of depression, it’s important to follow up with a doctor. All depression types discussed in this article are treatable, though it might take some time to find the right treatment for you.
 
 If you’ve had a previous bout of depression and think it may be happening again, see your psychiatrist or other mental health professional right away.
 
 If you’ve never had depression before, start with your primary care physician. Some symptoms of depression can be related to an underlying physical condition that should be addressed.
 
 Try to give your doctor as much information about your symptoms as you can. If possible, mention:
 
 when you first noticed them
 how they’ve affected your daily life
 any other mental health conditions you have
 any information about a history of mental illness in your family
 all prescription and over-the-counter medications you take, including supplements and herbs
 It might feel uncomfortable, but try to tell your doctor everything. This will help them give you a more accurate diagnosis and refer you to the right type of mental health professional.

 What is depression?
 
 Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities.
 
 It’s also fairly common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source estimates that 8.1 percent of American adults ages 20 and over had depression in any given 2-week period from 2013 to 2016.
 
 People experience depression in different ways. It may interfere with your daily work, resulting in lost time and lower productivity. It can also influence relationships and some chronic health conditions.
 
 Conditions that can get worse due to depression include:
 
 arthritis
 asthma
 cardiovascular disease
 cancer
 diabetes
 obesity
 It’s important to realize that feeling down at times is a normal part of life. Sad and upsetting events happen to everyone. But, if you’re feeling down or hopeless on a regular basis, you could be dealing with depression.
 
 Depression is considered a serious medical condition that can get worse without proper treatment. Those who seek treatment often see improvements in symptoms in just a few weeks.
 
 Depression symptoms
 Depression can be more than a constant state of sadness or feeling “blue.”
 
 Major depression can cause a variety of symptoms. Some affect your mood, and others affect your body. Symptoms may also be ongoing, or come and go.
 
 The symptoms of depression can be experienced differently among men, women, and children differently.
 
 Men may experience symptoms related to their:
 
 mood, such as anger, aggressiveness, irritability, anxiousness, restlessness
 emotional well-being, such as feeling empty, sad, hopeless
 behavior, such as loss of interest, no longer finding pleasure in favorite activities, feeling tired easily, thoughts of suicide, drinking excessively, using drugs, engaging in high-risk activities
 sexual interest, such as reduced sexual desire, lack of sexual performance
 cognitive abilities, such as inability to concentrate, difficulty completing tasks, delayed responses during conversations
 sleep patterns, such as insomnia, restless sleep, excessive sleepiness, not sleeping through the night
 physical well-being, such as fatigue, pains, headache, digestive problems
 Women may experience symptoms related to their:
 
 mood, such as irritability
 emotional well-being, such as feeling sad or empty, anxious or hopeless
 behavior, such as loss of interest in activities, withdrawing from social engagements, thoughts of suicide
 cognitive abilities, such as thinking or talking more slowly
 sleep patterns, such as difficulty sleeping through the night, waking early, sleeping too much
 physical well-being, such as decreased energy, greater fatigue, changes in appetite, weight changes, aches, pain, headaches, increased cramps
 Children may experience symptoms related to their:
 
 mood, such as irritability, anger, mood swings, crying
 emotional well-being, such as feelings of incompetence (e.g. “I can’t do anything right”) or despair, crying, intense sadness
 behavior, such as getting into trouble at school or refusing to go to school, avoiding friends or siblings, thoughts of death or suicide
 cognitive abilities, such as difficulty concentrating, decline in school performance, changes in grades
 sleep patterns, such as difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much
 physical well-being, such as loss of energy, digestive problems, changes in appetite, weight loss or gain
 The symptoms can extend beyond your mind.
 
 These seven physical symptoms of depression prove that depression isn’t just all in your head.
 
 Depression causes
 There are several possible causes of depression. They can range from biological to circumstantial.
 
 Common causes include:
 
 Family history. You’re at a higher risk for developing depression if you have a family history of depression or another mood disorder.
 Early childhood trauma. Some events affect the way your body reacts to fear and stressful situations.
 Brain structure. There’s a greater risk for depression if the frontal lobe of your brain is less active. However, scientists don’t know if this happens before or after the onset of depressive symptoms.
 Medical conditions. Certain conditions may put you at higher risk, such as chronic illness, insomnia, chronic pain, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
 Drug use. A history of drug or alcohol misuse can affect your risk.
 About 21 percent of people who have a substance use problem also experience depression. In addition to these causes, other risk factors for depression include:
 
 low self-esteem or being self-critical
 personal history of mental illness
 certain medications
 stressful events, such as loss of a loved one, economic problems, or a divorce
 Many factors can influence feelings of depression, as well as who develops the condition and who doesn’t.
 
 The causes of depression are often tied to other elements of your health.
 
 However, in many cases, healthcare providers are unable to determine what’s causing depression.
 
 Depression test
 There isn’t a single test to diagnose depression. But your healthcare provider can make a diagnosis based on your symptoms and a psychological evaluation.
 
 In most cases, they’ll ask a series of questions about your:
 
 moods
 appetite
 sleep pattern
 activity level
 thoughts
 Because depression can be linked to other health problems, your healthcare provider may also conduct a physical examination and order blood work. Sometimes thyroid problems or a vitamin D deficiency can trigger symptoms of depression.
 
 Don’t ignore symptoms of depression. If your mood doesn’t improve or gets worse, seek medical help. Depression is a serious mental health illness with the potential for complications.
 
 If left untreated, complications can include:
 
 weight gain or loss
 physical pain
 substance use problems
 panic attacks
 relationship problems
 social isolation
 thoughts of suicide
 self-harm
 Types of depression
 Depression can be broken into categories depending on the severity of symptoms. Some people experience mild and temporary episodes, while others experience severe and ongoing depressive episodes.
 
 There are two main types: major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder.
 
 Major depressive disorder
 Major depressive disorder is the more severe form of depression. It’s characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness that don’t go away on their own.
 
 In order to be diagnosed with clinical depression, you must experience 5 or more of the following symptoms over a 2-week period:
 
 feeling depressed most of the day
 loss of interest in most regular activities
 significant weight loss or gain
 sleeping a lot or not being able to sleep
 slowed thinking or movement
 fatigue or low energy most days
 feelings of worthlessness or guilt
 loss of concentration or indecisiveness
 recurring thoughts of death or suicide
 There are different subtypes of major depressive disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association refers to as “specifiers.”
 
 These include:
 
 atypical features
 anxious distress
 mixed features
 peripartum onset, during pregnancy or right after giving birth
 seasonal patterns
 melancholic features
 psychotic features
 catatonia
 Persistent depressive disorder
 Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) used to be called dysthymia. It’s a milder, but chronic, form of depression.
 
 In order for the diagnosis to be made, symptoms must last for at least 2 years. PDD can affect your life more than major depression because it lasts for a longer period.
 
 It’s common for people with PDD to:
 
 lose interest in normal daily activities
 feel hopeless
 lack productivity
 have low self-esteem
 Depression can be treated successfully, but it’s important to stick to your treatment plan.
 
 Read more about why depression treatment is important.
 
 Treatment for depression
 Living with depression can be difficult, but treatment can help improve your quality of life. Talk to your healthcare provider about possible options.
 
 The Healthline FindCare tool can provide options in your area if you don’t already have a doctor.
 
 You may successfully manage symptoms with one form of treatment, or you may find that a combination of treatments works best.
 
 It’s common to combine medical treatments and lifestyle therapies, including the following:
 
 Medications
 Your healthcare provider may prescribe:
 
 antidepressants
 antianxiety
 antipsychotic medications
 Each type of medication that’s used to treat depression has benefits and potential risks.
 
 Psychotherapy
 Speaking with a therapist can help you learn skills to cope with negative feelings. You may also benefit from family or group therapy sessions.
 
 Online therapy options
 Read our review of the best online therapy options to find the right fit for you.
 
 Light therapy
 Exposure to doses of white light can help regulate your mood and improve symptoms of depression. Light therapy is commonly used in seasonal affective disorder, which is now called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern.
 
 Alternative therapies
 Ask your healthcare provider about acupuncture or meditation. Some herbal supplements are also used to treat depression, like St. John’s wort, SAMe, and fish oil.
 
 Talk with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement or combining a supplement with prescription medication because some supplements can react with certain medications. Some supplements may also worsen depression or reduce the effectiveness of medication.
 
 Exercise
 Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity 3 to 5 days a week. Exercise can increase your body’s production of endorphins, which are hormones that improve your mood.
 
 Avoid alcohol and drugs
 Drinking or misusing drugs may make you feel better for a little bit. But in the long run, these substances can make depression and anxiety symptoms worse.
 
 Learn how to say no
 Feeling overwhelmed can worsen anxiety and depression symptoms. Setting boundaries in your professional and personal life can help you feel better.
 
 Take care of yourself
 You can also improve symptoms of depression by taking care of yourself. This includes getting plenty of sleep, eating a healthy diet, avoiding negative people, and participating in enjoyable activities.
 
 Sometimes depression doesn’t respond to medication. Your healthcare provider may recommend other treatment options if your symptoms don’t improve.
 
 These include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat depression and improve your mood.
 
 Natural treatment for depression
 Traditional depression treatment uses a combination of prescription medication and counseling. But there are also alternative or complementary treatments you can try.
 
 It’s important to remember that many of these natural treatments have few studies showing their effects on depression, good or bad.
 
 Likewise, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t approve many of the dietary supplements on the market in the United States, so you want to make sure you’re buying products from a trustworthy brand.
 
 Talk to your healthcare provider before adding supplements to your treatment plan.
 
 Supplements
 Several types of supplements are thought to have some positive effect on depression symptoms.
 
 St. John’s wort
 Studies are mixed, but this natural treatment is used in Europe as an antidepressant medication. In the United States, it hasn’t received the same approval.
 
 S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe)
 This compound has shown in limited studies to possibly ease symptoms of depression. The effects were best seen in people taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of traditional antidepressant.
 
 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)
 5-HTP may raise serotonin levels in the brain, which could ease symptoms. Your body makes this chemical when you consume tryptophan, a protein building block.
 
 Omega-3 fatty acids
 These essential fats are important to neurological development and brain health. Adding omega-3 supplements to your diet may help reduce depression symptoms.
 
 Essential oils
 Essential oils are a popular natural remedy for many conditions, but research into their effects on depression is limited.
 
 People with depression may find symptom relief with the following essential oils:
 
 Wild ginger: Inhaling this strong scent may activate serotonin receptors in your brain. This may slow the release of stress-inducing hormones.
 Bergamot: This citrusy essential oil has been shown to reduce anxiety in patients awaiting surgery. The same benefit may help individuals who experience anxiety as a result of depression, but there’s no research to support that claim.
 Other oils, such as chamomile or rose oil, may have a calming effect when they’re inhaled. Those oils may be beneficial during short-term use.
 
 Vitamins
 Vitamins are important to many bodily functions. Research suggests two vitamins are especially useful for easing symptoms of depression:
 
 Vitamin B: B-12 and B-6 are vital to brain health. When your vitamin B levels are low, your risk for developing depression may be higher.
 Vitamin D: Sometimes called the sunshine vitamin because exposure to the sun supplies it to your body, Vitamin D is important for brain, heart, and bone health. People who are depressed are more likely to have low levels of this vitamin.
 Many herbs, supplements, and vitamins claim to help ease symptoms of depression, but most haven’t shown themselves to be effective in clinical research.
 
 Learn about herbs, vitamins, and supplements that have shown some promise, and ask your healthcare provider if any are right for you.

 Preventing depression
 Depression isn’t generally considered to be preventable. It’s hard to recognize what causes it, which means preventing it is more difficult.
 
 But once you’ve experienced a depressive episode, you may be better prepared to prevent a future episode by learning which lifestyle changes and treatments are helpful.
 
 Techniques that may help include:
 
 regular exercise
 getting plenty of sleep
 maintaining treatments
 reducing stress
 building strong relationships with others
 Other techniques and ideas may also help you prevent depression.
 
 Read the full list of 15 ways you may be able to avoid depression.
 
 Bipolar depression
 Bipolar depression occurs in certain types of bipolar disorder, when the person experiences a depressive episode.
 
 People with bipolar disorder may experience significant mood swings. Episodes in bipolar 2, for instance, typically range from manic episodes of high energy to depressive episodes of low energy.
 
 This depends on the type of bipolar disorder you have. A diagnosis of bipolar 1 only has to have the presence of manic episodes, not depression.
 
 Symptoms of depression in people with bipolar disorder may include:
 
 loss of interest or enjoyment from normal activities
 feeling sad, worried, anxious, or empty
 not having energy or struggling to complete tasks
 difficulty with recall or memory
 sleeping too much or insomnia
 weight gain or weight loss as a result of increased or decreased appetite
 contemplating death or suicide
 If bipolar disorder is treated, many will experience fewer and less severe symptoms of depression, if they experience depressive episodes.
 
 These 7 treatments may help ease symptoms of bipolar depression.
 
 Depression and anxiety
 Depression and anxiety can occur in a person at the same time. In fact, research has shown that over 70 percentTrusted Source of people with depressive disorders also have symptoms of anxiety.
 
 Though they’re thought to be caused by different things, depression and anxiety can produce several similar symptoms, which can include:
 
 irritability
 difficulty with memory or concentration
 sleep problems
 The two conditions also share some common treatments.
 
 Both anxiety and depression can be treated with:
 
 therapy, like cognitive behavioral therapy
 medication
 alternative therapies, including hypnotherapy
 If you think you’re experiencing symptoms of either of these conditions, or both of them, make an appointment to talk with your healthcare provider. You can work with them to identify coexisting symptoms of anxiety and depression and how they can be treated.

 Depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
 Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder. It causes unwanted and repeated thoughts, urges, and fears (obsessions).
 
 These fears cause you to act out repeated behaviors or rituals (compulsions) that you hope will ease the stress caused by the obsessions.
 
 People diagnosed with OCD frequently find themselves in a loop of obsessions and compulsions. If you have these behaviors, you may feel isolated because of them. This can lead to withdrawal from friends and social situations, which can increase your risk for depression.
 
 It’s not uncommon for someone with OCD to also have depression. Having one anxiety disorder can increase your odds for having another. Up to 80 percentTrusted Source of people with OCD also have major depression.
 
 This dual diagnosis is a concern with children, too. Their compulsive behaviors, which may be first developing at a young age, can make them feel unusual. That can lead to withdrawing from friends and can increase the chance of child developing depression.
 
 Depression with psychosis
 Some individuals who have been diagnosed with major depression may also have symptoms of another mental disorder called psychosis. When the two conditions occur together, it’s known as depressive psychosis.
 
 Depressive psychosis causes people to see, hear, believe, or smell things that aren’t real. People with the condition may also experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and irritability.
 
 The combination of the two conditions is particularly dangerous. That’s because someone with depressive psychosis may experience delusions that cause them to have thoughts of suicide or to take unusual risks.
 
 It’s unclear what causes these two conditions or why they can occur together, but treatment can successfully ease symptoms. Treatments include medications and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
 
 Understanding the risk factors and possible causes can help you be aware of early symptoms.
 
 Read more about depressive psychosis, how it’s treated, and what healthcare providers understand about why it occurs.
 
 Depression in pregnancy
 Pregnancy is often an exciting time for people. However, it can still be common for a pregnant woman to experience depression.
 
 Symptoms of depression during pregnancy include:
 
 changes in appetite or eating habits
 feeling hopeless
 anxiety
 losing interest in activities and things you previously enjoyed
 persistent sadness
 troubles concentrating or remembering
 sleep problems, including insomnia or sleeping too much
 thoughts of death or suicide
 Treatment for depression during pregnancy may focus entirely on talk therapy and other natural treatments.
 
 While some women do take antidepressants during their pregnancy, it’s not clear which ones are the safest. Your healthcare provider may encourage you to try an alternative option until after the birth of your baby.
 
 The risks for depression can continue after the baby arrives. Postpartum depression, which is also called major depressive disorder with peripartum onset, is a serious concern for new mothers.
 
 Recognizing the symptoms may help you spot a problem and seek help before it becomes overwhelming.
 
 Depression and alcohol
 Research has established a link between alcohol use and depression. People who have depression are more likely to misuse alcohol.
 
 Out of the 20.2 million U.S. adults who experienced a substance use disorder, about 40 percent had a cooccurring mental illness.
 
 According to a 2012 study, 63.8 percentTrusted Source of people who are alcohol dependent have depression.
 
 Drinking alcohol frequently can make symptoms of depression worse, and people who have depression are more likely to misuse alcohol or become dependent on it.
 
 Outlook for depression
 Depression can be temporary, or it can be a long-term challenge. Treatment doesn’t always make your depression go away completely.
 
 However, treatment often makes symptoms more manageable. Managing symptoms of depression involves finding the right combination of medications and therapies.
 
 If one treatment doesn’t work, talk with your healthcare provider. They can help you create a different treatment plan that may work better in helping you manage your condition.

 Sometimes depression doesn't get better, even with treatment. Explore what you can do about it.

 Psychiatry and Psychology: Mayo Clinic Depression Center
 If you've been treated for depression but your symptoms haven't improved, you may have treatment-resistant depression. Taking an antidepressant or going to psychological counseling (psychotherapy) eases depression symptoms for most people. But with treatment-resistant depression, standard treatments aren't enough. They may not help much at all, or your symptoms may improve, only to keep coming back.
 
 If your primary care doctor prescribed antidepressants and your depression symptoms continue despite treatment, ask your doctor if he or she can recommend a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions.
 
 The psychiatrist reviews your medical history and may:
 
 Ask about life situations that might be contributing to your depression
 Consider your response to treatment, including medications, psychotherapy or other treatments you've tried
 Review all of the medications you're taking, including nonprescription drugs and herbal supplements
 Discuss whether you're taking your medications as prescribed and following other treatment steps
 Consider physical health conditions that can sometimes cause or worsen depression, such as thyroid disorders, chronic pain or heart problems
 Consider a diagnosis of another mental health condition, such as bipolar disorder, which can cause or worsen depression and may require different treatment; dysthymia, a mild but long-term (chronic) form of depression; or a personality disorder that contributes to the depression not getting better
 Treatment-resistant depression symptoms can range from mild to severe and may require trying a number of approaches to identify what helps.
 
 Medication strategies
 If you've already tried an antidepressant and it didn't work, don't lose hope. You and your physician simply may not have found the right dose, medication or combination of medications that works for you. Here are some medication options that your doctor may discuss with you:
 
 Give your current medications more time. Antidepressants and other medications for depression typically take four to eight weeks to become fully effective and for side effects to ease up. For some people, it takes even longer.
 Increase your dose, if indicated. Because people respond to medications differently, you may benefit from a higher dose of medication than is usually prescribed. Ask your doctor whether this is an option for you — don't change your dose on your own as several factors are involved in determining the proper dose.
 Switch antidepressants. For a number of people, the first antidepressant tried isn't effective. You may need to try several before you find one that works for you.
 Add another type of antidepressant. Your doctor may prescribe two different classes of antidepressants at the same time. That way they'll affect a wider range of brain chemicals linked to mood. These chemicals are neurotransmitters that include dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.
 Add a medication generally used for another condition. Your doctor may prescribe a medication that's generally used for another mental or physical health problem, along with an antidepressant. This approach, known as augmentation, may include antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety medications, thyroid hormone or other drugs.
 Consider pharmacogenetic testing. These tests check for specific genes that indicate how well your body can process (metabolize) a medication or how your depression might respond to a particular medication based on additional factors. Currently, pharmacogenetics tests are not a sure way to show if a medication will work for you, but these tests can provide important clues for treatment, particularly in people who have many side effects or have had poor results with certain medications. These tests are not always covered by insurance.
 Psychological counseling
 Psychological counseling (psychotherapy) by a psychiatrist, psychologist or other mental health professional can be very effective. For many people, psychotherapy combined with medication works best. It can help identify underlying concerns that may be adding to your depression. In working with your therapist, you can also learn specific behaviors and strategies to overcome your depression. For example, psychotherapy can help you:
 
 Find better ways to cope with life's challenges
 Deal with past emotional trauma
 Manage relationships in a healthier way
 Learn how to reduce the effects of stress in your life
 Address substance use issues
 If counseling doesn't seem helpful, talk to your psychotherapist about trying a different approach. Or consider seeing someone else. As with medications, it may take several tries to find a treatment that works. Psychotherapy for depression may include:
 
 Cognitive behavioral therapy. This common type of counseling addresses thoughts, feelings and behaviors that affect your mood. It helps you identify and change distorted or negative thinking patterns and teaches you skills to respond to life's challenges in a positive way.
 Acceptance and commitment therapy. A form of cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy helps you to engage in positive behaviors, even when you have negative thoughts and emotions. It's designed for treatment-resistant conditions.
 Interpersonal psychotherapy. Interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on resolving relationship issues that may contribute to your depression.
 Family or marital therapy. This type of therapy involves family members or your spouse or partner in counseling. Working out stress in your relationships can help with depression.
 Dialectical behavioral therapy. This type of therapy helps you build acceptance strategies and problem-solving skills. This is useful for chronic suicidal thoughts or self-injury behaviors, which sometimes accompany treatment-resistant depression.
 Group psychotherapy. This type of counseling involves a group of people who struggle with depression working together with a psychotherapist.
 Mindfulness. Mindfulness involves paying attention and accepting one's thoughts and feelings without judging them as ""right"" or ""wrong"" in a given moment.
 Behavioral activation. This type of treatment works with depressed individuals to gradually decrease their avoidance and isolation and increase their engagement in activities that they once enjoyed or activities that have been shown to improve mood.
 Procedures to treat depression
 If medications and psychotherapy aren't working, you may want to talk to a psychiatrist about additional treatment options:
 
 Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This type of treatment uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression. An electromagnetic coil is placed against your scalp near your forehead. The electromagnet used in rTMS creates electric currents that stimulate nerve cells in the region of your brain involved in mood control and depression. Typically, this treatment is delivered over 30-minute sessions in rapid bursts. This treatment can now be delivered over briefer sessions with dosing called intermittent theta burst stimulation.
 Ketamine is a medication that's delivered through an IV in low doses. It's used for rapid relief of hard-to-treat depressive symptoms and its effects can last from days to weeks. Usually it's given in decreasing frequencies over several weeks. The FDA approved an intranasal form called esketamine that's given in a physician's office or a clinic under the supervision of a health care provider to monitor for possible serious side effects and because of the potential for abuse and misuse. Esketamine is for adults who have tried at least two other antidepressant medications that did not adequately control symptoms. Ketamine and esketamine work in the brain in a different way than standard antidepressants, and each is typically used along with an oral antidepressant.
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). While you're asleep, a carefully measured dose of electricity is passed through your brain, intentionally triggering a small, brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can relatively quickly reverse symptoms of major depression. Although there are potential side effects, such as temporary confusion or temporary memory loss, a series of ECT treatments may provide significant relief of severe depression.
 Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Generally, VNS is only tried after other brain stimulation therapies such as ECT and rTMS have not been successful in improving symptoms of depression. VNS stimulates the vagus nerve with electrical impulses. This treatment uses a device implanted in your chest that's connected by a wire to a nerve in your neck (vagus nerve). Electrical signals from the implant travel along the vagus nerve to the mood centers of the brain, which may improve depression symptoms.
 Be sure to find out whether your insurance covers any treatment that's recommended.
 
 Other steps you can take
 To make the most of depression treatment:
 
 Stick to your treatment plan. Don't skip therapy sessions or appointments. It'll take time to get better. Even if you feel well, don't skip your medications. If you stop, depression symptoms may come back, and you could experience withdrawal-like symptoms. If side effects or drug costs are a problem, talk with your doctor and pharmacist to discuss options.
 Stop drinking or using recreational drugs. Many people with depression drink too much alcohol or use recreational drugs or marijuana. In the long run, alcohol and drugs worsen depression and make it harder to treat. If you can't stop drinking alcohol or using drugs on your own, talk to your doctor or mental health professional. Depression treatment may be unsuccessful until you address your substance use.
 Manage stress. Relationship issues, financial problems, an unhappy work life and many other issues can all contribute to stress, which in turn worsens depression. Try stress-reduction techniques such as yoga, tai chi, meditation, mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation or writing your thoughts in a journal.
 Sleep well. Poor sleep may worsen depression. Both the amount of time and how well you sleep can affect your mood, energy level, ability to concentrate and resilience to stress. If you have trouble sleeping, research ways to improve your sleep habits or ask your doctor or mental health professional for advice.
 Get regular exercise. Exercise has a direct effect on mood. Even physical activity such as gardening or walking can reduce stress, improve sleep and ease depression symptoms.
 Don't settle for a treatment that's partially effective at relieving your depression or one that works but causes intolerable side effects. Work with your doctor or other mental health professional to find the best treatment possible, even though it may take time and effort to try new approaches.

1934,0,"Depression in women: Understanding the gender gap
 About twice as many women as men experience depression. Several factors may increase a woman's risk of depression.
 
 By Mayo Clinic Staff
 Women are nearly twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression. Depression can occur at any age.
 
 Some mood changes and depressed feelings occur with normal hormonal changes. But hormonal changes alone don't cause depression. Other biological factors, inherited traits, and personal life circumstances and experiences are associated with a higher risk of depression. Here's what contributes to depression in women.
 
 Puberty
 Hormone changes during puberty may increase some girls' risk of developing depression. However, temporary mood swings related to fluctuating hormones during puberty are normal — these changes alone don't cause depression.
 
 Puberty is often associated with other experiences that can play a role in depression, such as:
 
 Emerging sexuality and identity issues
 Conflicts with parents
 Increasing pressure to achieve in school, sports or other areas of life
 After puberty, depression rates are higher in females than in males. Because girls typically reach puberty before boys do, they're more likely to develop depression at an earlier age than boys are. There is evidence to suggest that this depression gender gap may continue throughout the lifespan.
 
 Premenstrual problems
 For most females with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), symptoms such as abdominal bloating, breast tenderness, headache, anxiety, irritability and experiencing the blues are minor and short-lived.
 
 But a small number of females have severe and disabling symptoms that disrupt their studies, jobs, relationships or other areas of their lives. At that point, PMS may cross the line into premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) — a type of depression that generally requires treatment.
 
 The exact interaction between depression and PMS remains unclear. It's possible that cyclical changes in estrogen, progesterone and other hormones can disrupt the function of brain chemicals such as serotonin that control mood. Inherited traits, life experiences and other factors appear to play a role.
 
 Pregnancy
 Dramatic hormonal changes occur during pregnancy, and these can affect mood. Other issues also may increase the risk of developing depression during pregnancy or during attempts to become pregnant, such as:
 
 Lifestyle or work changes or other life stressors
 Relationship problems
 Previous episodes of depression, postpartum depression or PMDD
 Lack of social support
 Unintended or unwanted pregnancy
 Miscarriage
 Infertility
 Stopping use of antidepressant medications
 Postpartum depression
 Many new mothers find themselves sad, angry and irritable, and experience crying spells soon after giving birth. These feelings — sometimes called the baby blues — are normal and generally subside within a week or two. But more-serious or long-lasting depressed feelings may indicate postpartum depression, particularly if signs and symptoms include:
 
 Crying more often than usual
 Low self-esteem or feeling like you're a bad mom
 Anxiety or feeling numb
 Trouble sleeping, even when your baby is sleeping
 Problems with daily functioning
 Inability to care for your baby
 Thoughts of harming your baby
 Thoughts of suicide
 Postpartum depression is a serious medical condition requiring prompt treatment. It occurs in about 10 to 15 percent of women. It's thought to be associated with:
 
 Major hormonal fluctuations that influence mood
 The responsibility of caring for a newborn
 Predisposition to mood and anxiety disorders
 Pregnancy and birth complications
 Breast-feeding problems
 Infant complications or special needs
 Poor social support
 Perimenopause and menopause
 Risk of depression may increase during the transition to menopause, a stage called perimenopause, when hormone levels may fluctuate erratically. Depression risk may also rise during early menopause or after menopause — both times when estrogen levels are significantly reduced.
 
 Most women who experience bothersome menopausal symptoms don't develop depression. But these factors may increase the risk:
 
 Interrupted or poor sleep
 Anxiety or a history of depression
 Stressful life events
 Weight gain or a higher body mass index (BMI)
 Menopause at a younger age
 Menopause caused by surgical removal of the ovaries
 Life circumstances and culture
 The higher rate of depression in women isn't due to biology alone. Life circumstances and cultural stressors can play a role, too. Although these stressors also occur in men, it's usually at a lower rate. Factors that may increase the risk of depression in women include:
 
 Unequal power and status. Women are much more likely than men to live in poverty, causing concerns such as uncertainty about the future and decreased access to community and health care resources. These issues can cause feelings of negativity, low self-esteem and lack of control over life.
 Work overload. Often women work outside the home and still handle home responsibilities. Many women deal with the challenges of single parenthood, such as working multiple jobs to make ends meet. Also, women may be caring for their children while also caring for sick or older family members.
 Sexual or physical abuse. Women who were emotionally, physically or sexually abused as children or adults are more likely to experience depression at some point in their lives than those who weren't abused. Women are more likely than men to experience sexual abuse.
 Other conditions that occur with depression
 Women with depression often have other mental health conditions that need treatment as well, such as:
 
 Anxiety. Anxiety commonly occurs along with depression in women.
 Eating disorders. There's a strong link between depression in women and eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia.
 Drug or alcohol misuse. Some women with depression also have some form of unhealthy substance use or dependence. Substance misuse can worsen depression and make it harder to treat.
 Recognizing depression and seeking treatment
 Although depression might seem overwhelming, there's effective treatment. Even severe depression often can be successfully treated. Seek help if you have any signs and symptoms of depression, such as:
 
 Ongoing feelings of sadness, guilt or hopelessness
 Loss of interest in things you once enjoyed
 Significant changes in your sleep pattern, such as trouble falling or staying asleep or sleeping too much
 Fatigue or unexplained pain or other physical symptoms without an apparent cause
 Problems concentrating or remembering things
 Changes in appetite leading to significant weight loss or weight gain
 Physical aches and pains
 Feeling as though life isn't worth living, or having thoughts of suicide
 Not sure how to get treatment? Consider turning to your primary care provider first — for example, your family doctor, internist, nurse practitioner, obstetrician or gynecologist. If needed, your primary care provider can refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating depression.
 
 Remember, depression is both common and treatable. If you think you're depressed, don't hesitate to seek help.

1935,1,"Overview
 Teen depression is a serious mental health problem that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in activities. It affects how your teenager thinks, feels and behaves, and it can cause emotional, functional and physical problems. Although depression can occur at any time in life, symptoms may be different between teens and adults.
 
 Issues such as peer pressure, academic expectations and changing bodies can bring a lot of ups and downs for teens. But for some teens, the lows are more than just temporary feelings — they're a symptom of depression.
 
 Teen depression isn't a weakness or something that can be overcome with willpower — it can have serious consequences and requires long-term treatment. For most teens, depression symptoms ease with treatment such as medication and psychological counseling.

 Symptoms
 Teen depression signs and symptoms include a change from the teenager's previous attitude and behavior that can cause significant distress and problems at school or home, in social activities, or in other areas of life.
 
 Depression symptoms can vary in severity, but changes in your teen's emotions and behavior may include the examples below.
 
 Emotional changes
 Be alert for emotional changes, such as:
 
 Feelings of sadness, which can include crying spells for no apparent reason
 Frustration or feelings of anger, even over small matters
 Feeling hopeless or empty
 Irritable or annoyed mood
 Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities
 Loss of interest in, or conflict with, family and friends
 Low self-esteem
 Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
 Fixation on past failures or exaggerated self-blame or self-criticism
 Extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure, and the need for excessive reassurance
 Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things
 Ongoing sense that life and the future are grim and bleak
 Frequent thoughts of death, dying or suicide
 Behavioral changes
 Watch for changes in behavior, such as:
 
 Tiredness and loss of energy
 Insomnia or sleeping too much
 Changes in appetite — decreased appetite and weight loss, or increased cravings for food and weight gain
 Use of alcohol or drugs
 Agitation or restlessness — for example, pacing, hand-wringing or an inability to sit still
 Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements
 Frequent complaints of unexplained body aches and headaches, which may include frequent visits to the school nurse
 Social isolation
 Poor school performance or frequent absences from school
 Less attention to personal hygiene or appearance
 Angry outbursts, disruptive or risky behavior, or other acting-out behaviors
 Self-harm — for example, cutting, burning, or excessive piercing or tattooing
 Making a suicide plan or a suicide attempt
 What's normal and what's not
 It can be difficult to tell the difference between ups and downs that are just part of being a teenager and teen depression. Talk with your teen. Try to determine whether he or she seems capable of managing challenging feelings, or if life seems overwhelming.
 
 When to see a doctor
 If depression signs and symptoms continue, begin to interfere in your teen's life, or cause you to have concerns about suicide or your teen's safety, talk to a doctor or a mental health professional trained to work with adolescents. Your teen's family doctor or pediatrician is a good place to start. Or your teen's school may recommend someone.
 
 Depression symptoms likely won't get better on their own — and they may get worse or lead to other problems if untreated. Depressed teenagers may be at risk of suicide, even if signs and symptoms don't appear to be severe.
 
 If you're a teen and you think you may be depressed — or you have a friend who may be depressed — don't wait to get help. Talk to a health care provider such as your doctor or school nurse. Share your concerns with a parent, a close friend, a spiritual leader, a teacher or someone else you trust.
 
 When to get emergency help
 Suicide is often associated with depression. If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.
 
 Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts:
 
 Call your mental health professional.
 Call a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or use its webchat on suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat.
 Seek help from your primary care doctor or other health care provider.
 Reach out to a close friend or loved one.
 Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.
 If a loved one or friend is in danger of attempting suicide or has made an attempt:
 
 Make sure someone stays with that person.
 Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.
 Or, if you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.
 Never ignore comments or concerns about suicide. Always take action to get help.

 Causes
 It's not known exactly what causes depression, but a variety of issues may be involved. These include:
 
 Brain chemistry. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that carry signals to other parts of your brain and body. When these chemicals are abnormal or impaired, the function of nerve receptors and nerve systems changes, leading to depression.
 Hormones. Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression.
 Inherited traits. Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives — such as a parent or grandparent — also have the condition.
 Early childhood trauma. Traumatic events during childhood, such as physical or emotional abuse, or loss of a parent, may cause changes in the brain that make a person more susceptible to depression.
 Learned patterns of negative thinking. Teen depression may be linked to learning to feel helpless — rather than learning to feel capable of finding solutions for life's challenges.
 Risk factors
 Many factors increase the risk of developing or triggering teen depression, including:
 
 Having issues that negatively impact self-esteem, such as obesity, peer problems, long-term bullying or academic problems
 Having been the victim or witness of violence, such as physical or sexual abuse
 Having other mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, an anxiety disorder, a personality disorder, anorexia or bulimia
 Having a learning disability or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
 Having ongoing pain or a chronic physical illness such as cancer, diabetes or asthma
 Having certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem or being overly dependent, self-critical or pessimistic
 Abusing alcohol, nicotine or other drugs
 Being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender in an unsupportive environment
 Family history and issues with family or others may also increase your teenager's risk of depression, such as:
 
 Having a parent, grandparent or other blood relative with depression, bipolar disorder or alcohol use problems
 Having a family member who died by suicide
 Having a dysfunctional family and family conflict
 Having experienced recent stressful life events, such as parental divorce, parental military service or the death of a loved one
 Complications
 Untreated depression can result in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your teenager's life. Complications related to teen depression may include, for example:
 
 Alcohol and drug misuse
 Academic problems
 Family conflicts and relationship difficulties
 Involvement with the juvenile justice system
 Suicide attempts or suicide
 Prevention
 There's no sure way to prevent depression. However, these strategies may help. Encourage your teenager to:
 
 Take steps to control stress, increase resilience and boost self-esteem to help handle issues when they arise
 Reach out for friendship and social support, especially in times of crisis
 Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent depression from worsening
 Maintain ongoing treatment, if recommended, even after symptoms let up, to help prevent a relapse of depression symptoms

 OVERVIEW
 What is seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is depression that gets triggered by a change in seasons, usually when fall starts. This seasonal depression gets worse in the winter before ending in the spring.
 
 Some people may get a mild version of SAD known as the “winter blues.” It’s normal to feel a little down during colder months. You may be stuck inside, and it gets dark early.
 
 But full SAD goes beyond that — it’s a form of depression. Unlike the winter blues, SAD affects your daily life, including how you feel and think. Fortunately, treatment can help you get through this challenging time.
 
 Can people get summer depression?
 Some people get a rare form of SAD called “summer depression.” It starts in the late spring or early summer and ends in the fall.
 
 How common is seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 About 5% of adults in the United States experience SAD. It tends to start in young adulthood. SAD affects women more than men, though researchers aren’t sure why. About 75% of people who get seasonal affective disorder are women.
 
 About 10% to 20% of people in America may get a milder form of the winter blues.
 
 Who is at risk for seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 SAD is more common in younger people and women. You’re also at higher risk if you:
 
 Have another mood disorder, such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder.
 Have relatives with other mental health conditions, such as depression or schizophrenia.
 Live at high latitudes (farther north of the equator), such as Alaska or New England.
 Live in cloudy regions.
 People with seasonal affective disorder may also have other mental conditions, such as:
 
 Anxiety disorder.
 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
 Eating disorder.
 Panic disorder.
 SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES
 What causes seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 Researchers don’t know exactly what causes seasonal depression. The lack of sunlight may trigger the condition in people who are prone to getting it. The theories suggest:
 
 Biological clock change: When someone has less exposure to sunlight, their biological clock shifts. This internal clock regulates mood, sleep and hormones. When it changes, people may have trouble regulating their moods.
 Brain chemical imbalance: Brain chemicals called neurotransmitters send communications between nerves. These chemicals include serotonin, which contributes to feelings of happiness. People at risk of SAD may already have less serotonin activity. Since sunlight helps regulate serotonin, the lack of winter sun can make the situation worse. Serotonin levels can fall further, leading to mood changes.
 Vitamin D deficit: Serotonin also gets a boost from vitamin D. Since sunlight helps us produce vitamin D, less sun in the winter can lead to a vitamin D deficiency. That change can affect serotonin and mood.
 Melatonin boost: Melatonin is a chemical that affects sleep patterns. The lack of sunlight may stimulate an overproduction of melatonin in some people. They may feel sluggish and sleepy during the winter.
 Negative thoughts: People with SAD often have stress, anxiety and negative thoughts about the winter. Researchers aren’t sure if these negative thoughts are a cause or effect of seasonal depression.
 What are the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 SAD is a type of depression, rather than a separate disorder. So people who have seasonal affective disorder may have signs of depression, including:
 
 Sadness.
 Anxiety.
 Carbohydrate cravings and weight gain.
 Extreme fatigue and lack of energy.
 Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness.
 Inability to concentrate.
 Irritability.
 Limbs feeling heavy.
 Loss of interest in usual activities, including withdrawing from social activities.
 Sleeping more.
 Thoughts of death or suicide.
 People who have summer SAD may experience:
 
 Agitation and restlessness.
 Anxiety.
 Decreased appetite and weight loss.
 Episodes of violent behavior.
 Trouble sleeping.
 DIAGNOSIS AND TESTS
 How is seasonal affective disorder (SAD) diagnosed?
 If you have symptoms of SAD, don’t try to diagnose yourself. See a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation. You may have a physical issue that’s causing depression. But many times, seasonal affective disorder is part of a more complex mental health issue.
 
 Your provider may refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist. These mental health professionals talk to you about your symptoms. They consider the pattern of symptoms and decide if you have seasonal depression or another mood disorder. You may need to fill out a questionnaire to determine if you have SAD.
 
 What tests will I need to diagnose seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 There’s no blood test or scan to diagnose seasonal depression. Still, your provider may recommend testing to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms.
 
 What are the criteria for a seasonal affective disorder (SAD) diagnosis?
 Your provider may diagnose you with SAD if you have:
 
 Symptoms of major depression.
 Depressive episodes that occur during specific seasons for at least two consecutive years.
 Depressive episodes that happen more frequently during a specific season than during the rest of the year.
 MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT
 How is seasonal affective disorder (SAD) treated?
 Your provider will talk to you about treatment options. You may need a combination of treatments, including:
 
 Phototherapy: Bright light therapy, using a special lamp, can treat SAD.
 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): A type of talk therapy called CBT can also effectively treat SAD. Research has shown that CBT produces the longest-lasting effects of any treatment approach.
 Antidepressant medication: Sometimes, providers recommend medication for depression, either alone or with light therapy.
 Spending time outdoors: Getting more sunlight can help improve symptoms. Try to get out during the day. Also increase the amount of sunlight that enters your home or office.
 Vitamin D: A vitamin D supplement may help improve symptoms.
 How does light therapy work?
 To use light therapy, or phototherapy, you get a special lamp. It has white fluorescent light tubes covered with a plastic screen to block ultraviolet rays. The light is about 20 times brighter than regular indoor light. The intensity of light emitted should be 10,000 lux.
 
 To use phototherapy, don’t look directly into the light. Place the lamp about 2 or 3 feet away while you read, eat or do other activities.
 
 What time of day should I use light therapy?
 When you use light therapy may impact how effective it is. Morning light therapy seems to work better. Plus, using it later in the day may cause insomnia. Many health professionals recommend 10,000 lux for 15 to 30 minutes every morning.
 
 How long will it take light therapy to work?
 People who use a lamp for SAD often see results within two to four days. It may take about two weeks to reach the full benefits.
 
 How long do I use light therapy for?
 Healthcare providers often recommend using light therapy through the entire winter. SAD symptoms can return quickly after stopping light therapy. Continuing to use the therapy can help you feel your best throughout the season.
 
 Is light therapy safe?
 Light therapy is typically safe and well-tolerated. But you may need to avoid light therapy if you:
 
 Have diabetes or retinopathies: If you have diabetes or a retina condition, there’s a potential risk of damaging the retina, the back of your eye.
 Take some medications: Certain antibiotics and anti-inflammatories can make you more sensitive to sunlight. Light therapy can then cause harm.
 Have bipolar disorder: Bright light therapy can trigger hypomania or mania, uncontrolled boosts in mood and energy level. People with bipolar disorder need medical supervision to use light therapy.
 What are the side effects of light therapy?
 You may experience:
 
 Eyestrain.
 Fatigue.
 Headaches.
 Insomnia.
 Irritability.
 Can I use a tanning bed instead of light therapy to treat seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 Don’t use tanning beds to treat SAD. Tanning beds do generate enough light, but they can cause other harm. They produce a high amount of UV rays that can hurt your skin and eyes.
 
 What type of antidepressants can help with seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 Medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can treat SAD. They improve mood by regulating serotonin levels in your body.
 
 Another approved antidepressant called bupropion comes as an extended-release tablet. It can prevent seasonal depression episodes when people take it daily from fall to early spring.
 
 PREVENTION
 Can I prevent seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 You may not be able to prevent the first episode of SAD. But once your provider has diagnosed you with seasonal depression, you can take steps to help keep it from coming back:
 
 Use your light box: Start using light therapy at the beginning of fall, before you feel SAD symptoms.
 Get out: Spend time outside every day, even if it’s cloudy. Daylight can help you feel better.
 Eat a well-balanced diet: Even though your body may crave starchy and sweet foods, stick to nutritious choices. A healthy diet with enough vitamins and minerals can give you the energy you need.
 Exercise: Try to get 30 minutes of exercise, three times a week.
 See friends: Stay involved with your social circle and regular activities. They can provide support during the winter months.
 Find help: Consider seeing a mental health professional who’s trained in CBT. This treatment can be very effective for seasonal affective disorder.
 Consider medications: Talk to your healthcare provider about taking an antidepressant. Medications can help if your symptoms are severe or if they continue after other treatments. In some cases, taking the medication before SAD begins can prevent episodes.
 Talk to your healthcare provider to find out if starting treatment early, as a preventive measure, is right for you.
 
 OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
 What’s the outlook for people with seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 The outlook is positive. Treatments are available for SAD. People who get the right diagnosis and combination of treatments can find relief from symptoms. Talk to your healthcare provider to figure out the treatment that will work best for you.
 
 Can seasonal affective disorder (SAD) come back?
 People who are prone to seasonal affective disorder can get it every year. But you can take steps to prevent or lessen symptoms.
 
 LIVING WITH
 How can I best take care of myself if I have seasonal affective disorder?
 Talk to your healthcare provider. By planning ahead, you can manage your symptoms and feel your best.
 
 Do:
 
 Stick to your treatment plan: If you have medications or a lamp for SAD, use them as directed. Follow up with your healthcare provider if you don’t see an improvement in your symptoms.
 Care for yourself: Eat a well-balanced diet. Get enough sleep. Exercise regularly. Try to manage stress, perhaps by talking to a counselor or therapist.
 Plan ahead: Make a plan for what you’ll do if your symptoms get worse. If you notice signs of depression, take action. It might help to plan a lot of activities during these months. Having a busy schedule keeps you from hunkering down at home.
 Start treatment early: Talk to your healthcare provider about preventive treatment. If you know your symptoms start in October, consider starting treatment in September.
 Don’t:
 
 Isolate yourself: Being alone can make your symptoms worse. Even though you may not feel like going out or being social, try to reach out to friends and loved ones.
 Use alcohol or drugs: They might make symptoms worse. And they can interact negatively with antidepressants.
 When should I see my healthcare provider about seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
 If you think you have symptoms of seasonal depression or another mood disorder, see your healthcare provider. Your provider will want to rule out another condition or illness that may be causing these symptoms.
 
 When should I go to the emergency room?
 If you or a loved one has suicidal thoughts, get help. Call your provider, go to an emergency room, call 911 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, at 800.273.8255. This national network of local crisis centers provides free, confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress. It’s available 24/7.
 
 What should I ask my healthcare provider?
 If you have SAD, ask your provider:
 
 What treatment is best for me?
 How can I prevent depressive episodes?
 Will light therapy work?
 Should I take an antidepressant?
 When should I start treatment?
 How long should my treatment continue?
 What can I eat (or should avoid eating) to improve my symptoms?
 What else can I do to feel better?
 A note from Cleveland Clinic
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that happens every year during a specific season, usually winter. Symptoms can include a lack of energy and feelings of hopelessness. Fortunately, there’s treatment for seasonal depression. Talk to your healthcare provider. The provider may recommend a special lamp for SAD. The lamp emits bright light to improve symptoms. Antidepressants and talk therapy can also provide relief. If you’ve had seasonal depression in the past, talk to your provider about starting treatment before symptoms begin.",,
1937,1,"Tricyclic antidepressants and tetracyclic antidepressants
 Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants affect brain chemicals to ease depression symptoms. Explore their possible side effects and whether one of these antidepressants may be a good option for you.
 
 By Mayo Clinic Staff
 Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, also called cyclic antidepressants, are among the earliest antidepressants developed. They're effective, but they've generally been replaced by antidepressants that cause fewer side effects. However, cyclic antidepressants may be a good option for some people. In certain cases, they relieve depression when other treatments have failed.
 
 Cyclic antidepressants are designated as tricyclic or tetracyclic, depending on the number of rings in their chemical structure — three (tri) or four (tetra).
 
 How cyclic antidepressants work
 Cyclic antidepressants ease depression by affecting chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) used to communicate between brain cells. Like most antidepressants, cyclic antidepressants work by ultimately effecting changes in brain chemistry and communication in brain nerve cell circuitry known to regulate mood, to help relieve depression.
 
 Cyclic antidepressants block the reabsorption (reuptake) of the neurotransmitters serotonin (ser-o-TOE-nin) and norepinephrine (nor-ep-ih-NEF-rin), increasing the levels of these two neurotransmitters in the brain. Cyclic antidepressants also affect other chemical messengers, which can lead to a number of side effects.
 
 Cyclic antidepressants approved to treat depression
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved these tricyclic antidepressants to treat depression:
 
 Amitriptyline
 Amoxapine
 Desipramine (Norpramin)
 Doxepin
 Imipramine (Tofranil)
 Nortriptyline (Pamelor)
 Protriptyline
 Trimipramine
 The FDA approved the tetracycline antidepressant maprotiline to treat depression.
 
 Sometimes cyclic antidepressants are used to treat conditions other than depression, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders or nerve-related (neuropathic) pain.
 
 Possible side effects and cautions
 Because of the different ways cyclic antidepressants work, side effects vary somewhat from medication to medication. Some side effects may go away after a time, while others may lead you and your doctor to try a different medication. Side effects may also be dependent on the dose, with higher doses often causing more side effects.
 
 Some common possible side effects include:
 
 Drowsiness
 Blurred vision
 Constipation
 Dry mouth
 Drop in blood pressure when moving from sitting to standing, which can cause lightheadedness
 Urine retention
 Other possible side effects include:
 
 Weight loss
 Increased appetite leading to weight gain
 Excessive sweating
 Tremor
 Sexual problems, such as difficulty achieving an erection, delayed orgasm or low sex drive
 Generally speaking:
 
 Amitriptyline, doxepin, imipramine and trimipramine are more likely to make you sleepy than other tricyclic antidepressants are. Taking these medications at bedtime may help.
 Amitriptyline, doxepin, imipramine and trimipramine are more likely to cause weight gain than other tricyclic antidepressants are.
 Nortriptyline and desipramine appear to have better tolerated side effects than other tricyclic antidepressants do.
 For antidepressants that cause sleepiness, be careful about doing activities that require you to be alert, such as driving a car, until you know how the medication will affect you.
 
 Which antidepressant is best for you depends on a number of issues, such as your symptoms and any other health conditions you may have. Ask your doctor and pharmacist about the most common possible side effects for your specific antidepressant and read the patient medication guide that comes with the prescription.
 
 Safety issues
 Some tricyclic antidepressants are more likely to cause side effects that affect safety, such as:
 
 Disorientation or confusion, particularly in older people when the dosage is too high
 Increased or irregular heart rate
 More-frequent seizures in people who have seizures
 Other issues to discuss with your doctor before you take a cyclic antidepressant:
 
 Antidepressants and pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using specific antidepressants. Some antidepressants may harm your baby if you take them during pregnancy or while you're breast-feeding. If you're taking an antidepressant and you're considering getting pregnant, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about the possible risks. Don't stop taking your medication without contacting your doctor first, as stopping might pose risks for you.
 Drug interactions. When taking an antidepressant, tell your doctor about any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, herbs or other supplements you're taking. Some antidepressants can cause dangerous reactions when combined with certain medications or herbal supplements.
 Serotonin syndrome. Rarely, an antidepressant can cause high levels of serotonin to accumulate in your body. Serotonin syndrome most often occurs when two medications that raise the level of serotonin are combined. These include other antidepressants, certain pain or headache medications, and the herbal supplement St. John's wort.
 Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include anxiety, agitation, high fever, sweating, confusion, tremors, restlessness, lack of coordination, major changes in blood pressure and a rapid heart rate.
 Seek immediate medical attention if you have any of these signs and symptoms.
 Safety and blood tests. Your doctor may recommend blood levels to determine the most effective dose. Some side effects and benefits of cyclic antidepressants depend on the dose. Overdose of cyclic antidepressants can be dangerous.
 Chronic health conditions. Cyclic antidepressants can cause problems in people with certain health conditions. For example, if you have glaucoma, an enlarged prostate, heart problems, diabetes, liver disease or a history of seizures, talk to your doctor about whether a cyclic antidepressant is a safe choice for you.
 Suicide risk and antidepressants
 Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the FDA requires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings, the strictest warnings for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed.
 
 Anyone taking an antidepressant should be watched closely for worsening depression or unusual behavior. If you or someone you know has suicidal thoughts when taking an antidepressant, immediately contact your doctor or get emergency help.
 
 Keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood.
 
 Stopping treatment with cyclic antidepressants
 Cyclic antidepressants aren't considered addictive. However, stopping antidepressant treatment abruptly or missing several doses can cause withdrawal-like symptoms. Symptoms may vary depending on how the drug works. This is sometimes called discontinuation syndrome. Work with your doctor to gradually and safely decrease your dose.
 
 Withdrawal-like symptoms can include:
 
 Agitation, irritability or anxiety
 Nausea
 Sweating
 Flu-like symptoms, such as chills and muscle aches
 Insomnia
 Lethargy
 Headache
 Finding the right antidepressant
 People may react differently to the same antidepressant. For example, a particular drug may work better — or not as well — for you than for another person. Or you may have more, or fewer, side effects from taking a specific antidepressant than someone else does.
 
 Inherited traits may play a role in how antidepressants affect you. In some cases, where available, results of special blood tests may offer clues about how your body may respond to a specific antidepressant. However, other variables besides genetics can affect your response to medication.
 
 When choosing an antidepressant, your doctor takes into account your symptoms, any health problems, other medications you take, and what's worked for you in the past.
 
 Typically, it may take several weeks or longer before an antidepressant is fully effective and for initial side effects to ease up. Your doctor may recommend dose adjustments or different antidepressants, but with patience, you and your doctor can find a medication that works well for you.

1938,0,"Tips for Living With Major Depressive Disorder
 
 Some days are easier than others when you have major depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression. But other times, it can be more challenging to just get through your day-to-day activities.
 
 Whether it’s medication or therapy, it’s important that you stick with the treatment plan you’ve created with your doctor.
 
 But there are plenty of other steps you can take to make daily life easier.
 
 Practice Self-Care
 Do things that make you feel good -- that are just for you.
 
 You might want to listen to music or get a massage, sit in the sun or play with your pet. Take simple steps like treating yourself to special (healthy!) foods or a good product to take care of your skin.
 
 Don’t feel bad about taking time for yourself.
 
 Spend Time in Nature
 Several studies suggest that spending time in nature is good for well-being.
 
 DID YOU KNOW?
 The calming sounds of nature can lower blood pressure and your levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
 
 Living around trees and walking in nature can boost your mood and may even help you live longer. It can can lower levels of depression, stress, and anxiety, too.
 
 When you see and hear birds and trees and other natural sounds and sights, it’s easier to put negative thoughts and worries to the side. So find time to take a walk or just sit outside.
 
 Don’t Do Too Much
 It’s easy to take on too many commitments. Learn to say “no” if you have too much to do. It’s OK to have down time, especially when you’re feeling overwhelmed.
 
 Leave time for yourself so you don’t feel like you’re running all the time.
 
 Spend Time With Other People
 While it's important to say no, it's also important not to isolate yourself.
 
 It can be tempting to turn down invitations and just stay alone. But get together regularly with family and friends, even if it’s just by phone or video chat.
 
 Loneliness and isolation can make depression worse. You could find a group that offers meetings, counseling, and other resources for people who have depression. It helps to talk to people who are feeling the same way you are. Ask your doctor or therapist for tips on finding a group.
 
 If that seems like too much, you could also set up a weekly call or a regular walk with a friend.

 Keep a Journal
 Writing can help you express your emotions and track your mood. It’s a private way to let out your sadness, anger, pain, or anything else you’re feeling.
 
 When you look back and read what you wrote, it can also help you notice how people, places, or events made you feel.
 
 Put Off Key Decisions
 Don’t make big choices when you’re feeling low. It can be hard to decide even small things when you’re depressed. Wait until you feel better to tackle large issues.
 
 If you need to make a decision now, talk about your options with people who know you well who'll be able to look at both sides of the situation.
 
 Stay Educated
 Keep learning about depression. There are new studies and treatments created all the time. It’s true that knowledge is power.
 
 The more you know, the more capable you’ll feel when dealing with your condition.
 
 Don't Dwell
 It can be easy to get into the habit of rumination. That’s when you think about something over and over again.
 
 Instead, try to become aware of it when you’re doing it and learn to stop yourself. Focus instead on something that is more helpful and draw your thoughts to that instead.

1939,1,"Overview
 The birth of a baby can trigger a jumble of powerful emotions, from excitement and joy to fear and anxiety. But it can also result in something you might not expect — depression.
 
 Most new moms experience postpartum ""baby blues"" after childbirth, which commonly include mood swings, crying spells, anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Baby blues typically begin within the first two to three days after delivery, and may last for up to two weeks.
 
 But some new moms experience a more severe, long-lasting form of depression known as postpartum depression. Rarely, an extreme mood disorder called postpartum psychosis also may develop after childbirth.
 
 Postpartum depression isn't a character flaw or a weakness. Sometimes it's simply a complication of giving birth. If you have postpartum depression, prompt treatment can help you manage your symptoms and help you bond with your baby.
 
 
 Mayo Clinic Minute: Understanding Postpartum Depression
 Symptoms
 Signs and symptoms of depression after childbirth vary, and they can range from mild to severe.
 
 Baby blues symptoms
 Signs and symptoms of baby blues — which last only a few days to a week or two after your baby is born — may include:
 
 Mood swings
 Anxiety
 Sadness
 Irritability
 Feeling overwhelmed
 Crying
 Reduced concentration
 Appetite problems
 Trouble sleeping
 Postpartum depression symptoms
 Postpartum depression may be mistaken for baby blues at first — but the signs and symptoms are more intense and last longer, and may eventually interfere with your ability to care for your baby and handle other daily tasks. Symptoms usually develop within the first few weeks after giving birth, but may begin earlier ― during pregnancy ― or later — up to a year after birth.
 
 Postpartum depression signs and symptoms may include:
 
 Depressed mood or severe mood swings
 Excessive crying
 Difficulty bonding with your baby
 Withdrawing from family and friends
 Loss of appetite or eating much more than usual
 Inability to sleep (insomnia) or sleeping too much
 Overwhelming fatigue or loss of energy
 Reduced interest and pleasure in activities you used to enjoy
 Intense irritability and anger
 Fear that you're not a good mother
 Hopelessness
 Feelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt or inadequacy
 Diminished ability to think clearly, concentrate or make decisions
 Restlessness
 Severe anxiety and panic attacks
 Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby
 Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide
 Untreated, postpartum depression may last for many months or longer.
 
 Postpartum psychosis
 With postpartum psychosis — a rare condition that typically develops within the first week after delivery — the signs and symptoms are severe. Signs and symptoms may include:
 
 Confusion and disorientation
 Obsessive thoughts about your baby
 Hallucinations and delusions
 Sleep disturbances
 Excessive energy and agitation
 Paranoia
 Attempts to harm yourself or your baby
 Postpartum psychosis may lead to life-threatening thoughts or behaviors and requires immediate treatment.
 
 Postpartum depression in new fathers
 New fathers can experience postpartum depression, too. They may feel sad or fatigued, be overwhelmed, experience anxiety, or have changes in their usual eating and sleeping patterns ― the same symptoms mothers with postpartum depression experience.
 
 Fathers who are young, have a history of depression, experience relationship problems or are struggling financially are most at risk of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression in fathers ― sometimes called paternal postpartum depression ― can have the same negative effect on partner relationships and child development as postpartum depression in mothers can.
 
 If you're a new father and are experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety during your partner's pregnancy or in the first year after your child's birth, talk to your health care professional. Similar treatments and supports provided to mothers with postpartum depression can be beneficial in treating postpartum depression in fathers.
 
 When to see a doctor
 If you're feeling depressed after your baby's birth, you may be reluctant or embarrassed to admit it. But if you experience any symptoms of postpartum baby blues or postpartum depression, call your doctor and schedule an appointment. If you have symptoms that suggest you may have postpartum psychosis, get help immediately.
 
 It's important to call your doctor as soon as possible if the signs and symptoms of depression have any of these features:
 
 Don't fade after two weeks
 Are getting worse
 Make it hard for you to care for your baby
 Make it hard to complete everyday tasks
 Include thoughts of harming yourself or your baby
 If you have suicidal thoughts
 If at any point you have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby, immediately seek help from your partner or loved ones in taking care of your baby and call 911 or your local emergency assistance number to get help.
 
 Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts:
 
 Seek help from your primary care provider or other health care professional.
 Call a mental health professional.
 Call a suicide hotline. In the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or use their webchat on suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat.
 Reach out to a close friend or loved one.
 Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.
 Helping a friend or loved one
 People with depression may not recognize or acknowledge that they're depressed. They may not be aware of signs and symptoms of depression. If you suspect that a friend or loved one has postpartum depression or is developing postpartum psychosis, help them seek medical attention immediately. Don't wait and hope for improvement.

 Causes
 There's no single cause of postpartum depression, but physical and emotional issues may play a role.
 
 Physical changes. After childbirth, a dramatic drop in hormones (estrogen and progesterone) in your body may contribute to postpartum depression. Other hormones produced by your thyroid gland also may drop sharply — which can leave you feeling tired, sluggish and depressed.
 Emotional issues. When you're sleep deprived and overwhelmed, you may have trouble handling even minor problems. You may be anxious about your ability to care for a newborn. You may feel less attractive, struggle with your sense of identity or feel that you've lost control over your life. Any of these issues can contribute to postpartum depression.
 Risk factors
 Any new mom can experience postpartum depression and it can develop after the birth of any child, not just the first. However, your risk increases if:
 
 You have a history of depression, either during pregnancy or at other times
 You have bipolar disorder
 You had postpartum depression after a previous pregnancy
 You have family members who've had depression or other mood disorders
 You've experienced stressful events during the past year, such as pregnancy complications, illness or job loss
 Your baby has health problems or other special needs
 You have twins, triplets or other multiple births
 You have difficulty breast-feeding
 You're having problems in your relationship with your spouse or significant other
 You have a weak support system
 You have financial problems
 The pregnancy was unplanned or unwanted
 Complications
 Left untreated, postpartum depression can interfere with mother-child bonding and cause family problems.
 
 For mothers. Untreated postpartum depression can last for months or longer, sometimes becoming a chronic depressive disorder. Even when treated, postpartum depression increases a woman's risk of future episodes of major depression.
 For fathers. Postpartum depression can have a ripple effect, causing emotional strain for everyone close to a new baby. When a new mother is depressed, the risk of depression in the baby's father may also increase. And new dads are already at increased risk of depression, whether or not their partner is affected.
 For children. Children of mothers who have untreated postpartum depression are more likely to have emotional and behavioral problems, such as sleeping and eating difficulties, excessive crying, and delays in language development.
 Prevention
 If you have a history of depression — especially postpartum depression — tell your doctor if you're planning on becoming pregnant or as soon as you find out you're pregnant.
 
 During pregnancy, your doctor can monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of depression. He or she may have you complete a depression-screening questionnaire during your pregnancy and after delivery. Sometimes mild depression can be managed with support groups, counseling or other therapies. In other cases, antidepressants may be recommended — even during pregnancy.
 After your baby is born, your doctor may recommend an early postpartum checkup to screen for signs and symptoms of postpartum depression. The earlier it's detected, the earlier treatment can begin. If you have a history of postpartum depression, your doctor may recommend antidepressant treatment or psychotherapy immediately after delivery.

1940,0,"Depression and anxiety: Exercise eases symptoms
 Depression and anxiety symptoms often improve with exercise. Here are some realistic tips to help you get started and stay motivated.
 
 By Mayo Clinic Staff
 When you have depression or anxiety, exercise often seems like the last thing you want to do. But once you get motivated, exercise can make a big difference.
 
 Exercise helps prevent and improve a number of health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis. Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the psychological and physical benefits of exercise can also help improve mood and reduce anxiety.
 
 The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear — but working out and other forms of physical activity can definitely ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise may also help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better.
 
 How does exercise help depression and anxiety?
 Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by:
 
 Releasing feel-good endorphins, natural cannabis-like brain chemicals (endogenous cannabinoids) and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense of well-being
 Taking your mind off worries so you can get away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression and anxiety
 Regular exercise has many psychological and emotional benefits, too. It can help you:
 
 Gain confidence. Meeting exercise goals or challenges, even small ones, can boost your self-confidence. Getting in shape can also make you feel better about your appearance.
 Get more social interaction. Exercise and physical activity may give you the chance to meet or socialize with others. Just exchanging a friendly smile or greeting as you walk around your neighborhood can help your mood.
 Cope in a healthy way. Doing something positive to manage depression or anxiety is a healthy coping strategy. Trying to feel better by drinking alcohol, dwelling on how you feel, or hoping depression or anxiety will go away on its own can lead to worsening symptoms.
 Is a structured exercise program the only option?
 Some research shows that physical activity such as regular walking — not just formal exercise programs — may help improve mood. Physical activity and exercise are not the same thing, but both are beneficial to your health.
 
 Physical activity is any activity that works your muscles and requires energy and can include work or household or leisure activities.
 Exercise is a planned, structured and repetitive body movement done to improve or maintain physical fitness.
 The word ""exercise"" may make you think of running laps around the gym. But exercise includes a wide range of activities that boost your activity level to help you feel better.
 
 Certainly running, lifting weights, playing basketball and other fitness activities that get your heart pumping can help. But so can physical activity such as gardening, washing your car, walking around the block or engaging in other less intense activities. Any physical activity that gets you off the couch and moving can help improve your mood.
 
 You don't have to do all your exercise or other physical activity at once. Broaden how you think of exercise and find ways to add small amounts of physical activity throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park a little farther away from work to fit in a short walk. Or, if you live close to your job, consider biking to work.
 
 How much is enough?
 Doing 30 minutes or more of exercise a day for three to five days a week may significantly improve depression or anxiety symptoms. But smaller amounts of physical activity — as little as 10 to 15 minutes at a time — may make a difference. It may take less time exercising to improve your mood when you do more-vigorous activities, such as running or bicycling.
 
 The mental health benefits of exercise and physical activity may last only if you stick with it over the long term — another good reason to focus on finding activities that you enjoy.
 
 How do I get started — and stay motivated?
 Starting and sticking with an exercise routine or regular physical activity can be a challenge. These steps can help:
 
 Identify what you enjoy doing. Figure out what type of physical activities you're most likely to do, and think about when and how you'd be most likely to follow through. For instance, would you be more likely to do some gardening in the evening, start your day with a jog, or go for a bike ride or play basketball with your children after school? Do what you enjoy to help you stick with it.
 Get your mental health professional's support. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional for guidance and support. Discuss an exercise program or physical activity routine and how it fits into your overall treatment plan.
 Set reasonable goals. Your mission doesn't have to be walking for an hour five days a week. Think realistically about what you may be able to do and begin gradually. Tailor your plan to your own needs and abilities rather than setting unrealistic guidelines that you're unlikely to meet.
 Don't think of exercise or physical activity as a chore. If exercise is just another ""should"" in your life that you don't think you're living up to, you'll associate it with failure. Rather, look at your exercise or physical activity schedule the same way you look at your therapy sessions or medication — as one of the tools to help you get better.
 Analyze your barriers. Figure out what's stopping you from being physically active or exercising. If you feel self-conscious, for instance, you may want to exercise at home. If you stick to goals better with a partner, find a friend to work out with or who enjoys the same physical activities that you do. If you don't have money to spend on exercise gear, do something that's cost-free, such as regular walking. If you think about what's stopping you from being physically active or exercising, you can probably find an alternative solution.
 Prepare for setbacks and obstacles. Give yourself credit for every step in the right direction, no matter how small. If you skip exercise one day, that doesn't mean you can't maintain an exercise routine and might as well quit. Just try again the next day. Stick with it.
 Do I need to see my doctor?
 Check with your doctor before starting a new exercise program to make sure it's safe for you. Talk to your doctor to find out which activities, how much exercise and what intensity level is OK for you. Your doctor will consider any medications you take and your health conditions. He or she may also have helpful advice about getting started and staying motivated.
 
 If you exercise regularly but depression or anxiety symptoms still interfere with your daily living, see your doctor or mental health professional. Exercise and physical activity are great ways to ease symptoms of depression or anxiety, but they aren't a substitute for talk therapy (psychotherapy) or medications.

1941,1,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
 This commonly prescribed type of antidepressant can help you overcome depression. Discover how SSRIs improve mood and what side effects they may cause.
 
 By Mayo Clinic Staff
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. They can ease symptoms of moderate to severe depression, are relatively safe and typically cause fewer side effects than other types of antidepressants do.
 
 How SSRIs work
 SSRIs treat depression by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is one of the chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) that carry signals between brain nerve cells (neurons).
 
 SSRIs block the reabsorption (reuptake) of serotonin into neurons. This makes more serotonin available to improve transmission of messages between neurons. SSRIs are called selective because they mainly affect serotonin, not other neurotransmitters.
 
 SSRIs may also be used to treat conditions other than depression, such as anxiety disorders.
 
 SSRIs approved to treat depression
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved these SSRIs to treat depression:
 
 Citalopram (Celexa)
 Escitalopram (Lexapro)
 Fluoxetine (Prozac)
 Paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva)
 Sertraline (Zoloft)
 Possible side effects and cautions
 All SSRIs are thought to work in a similar way and generally can cause similar side effects, though some people may not experience any. Many side effects may go away after the first few weeks of treatment, while others may lead you and your doctor to try a different drug.
 
 If you can't tolerate one SSRI, you may be able to tolerate a different one, as SSRIs differ in their potencies at blocking serotonin reuptake and in how quickly the body eliminates (metabolizes) the drug.
 
 Possible side effects of SSRIs may include, among others:
 
 Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
 Headache
 Drowsiness
 Dry mouth
 Insomnia
 Nervousness, agitation or restlessness
 Dizziness
 Sexual problems, such as reduced sexual desire, difficulty reaching orgasm or inability to maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)
 Impact on appetite, leading to weight loss or weight gain
 Taking your medication with food may reduce the risk of nausea. Also, as long as your medication doesn't keep you from sleeping, you can reduce the impact of nausea by taking it at bedtime.
 
 Which antidepressant is best for you depends on a number of issues, such as your symptoms and any other health conditions you may have. Ask your doctor and pharmacist about the most common possible side effects for your specific SSRI and read the patient medication guide that comes with the prescription.
 
 Safety issues
 SSRIs are generally safe for most people. However, in some circumstances they can cause problems. For example, high doses of citalopram may cause dangerous abnormal heart rhythms, so doses over 40 milligrams (mg) a day should be avoided according to the FDA and the manufacturer. They also recommend a maximum daily dose of 20 mg of citalopram for people over age 60.
 
 Issues to discuss with your doctor before you take an SSRI include:
 
 Drug interactions. When taking an antidepressant, tell your doctor about any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, herbs or other supplements you're taking. Some antidepressants can interfere with the effectiveness of other medications, and some can cause dangerous reactions when combined with certain medications or herbal supplements.
 
 For example, SSRIs may increase your risk of bleeding, especially when you're taking other medications that increase the risk of bleeding, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and other blood thinners.
 
 Serotonin syndrome. Rarely, an antidepressant can cause high levels of serotonin to accumulate in your body. Serotonin syndrome most often occurs when two medications that raise the level of serotonin are combined. These include, for example, other antidepressants, certain pain or headache medications, and the herbal supplement St. John's wort.
 
 Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include anxiety, agitation, high fever, sweating, confusion, tremors, restlessness, lack of coordination, major changes in blood pressure and a rapid heart rate. Seek immediate medical attention if you have any of these signs or symptoms.
 
 Antidepressants and pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using specific antidepressants. Some antidepressants may harm your baby if you take them during pregnancy or while you're breast-feeding. If you're taking an antidepressant and you're considering getting pregnant, talk to your doctor about the possible risks. Don't stop taking your medication without contacting your doctor first, as stopping might pose risks for you.
 Suicide risk and antidepressants
 Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the FDA requires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings, the strictest warnings for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed.
 
 Anyone taking an antidepressant should be watched closely for worsening depression or unusual behavior. If you or someone you know has suicidal thoughts when taking an antidepressant, immediately contact your doctor or get emergency help.
 
 Keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood.
 
 Stopping treatment with SSRIs
 SSRIs aren't addictive. However, stopping antidepressant treatment abruptly or missing several doses can cause withdrawal-like symptoms. This is sometimes called discontinuation syndrome. Work with your doctor to gradually and safely decrease your dose.
 
 Withdrawal-like symptoms can include:
 
 General feeling of uneasiness
 Nausea
 Dizziness
 Lethargy
 Flu-like symptoms
 Finding the right antidepressant
 People may react differently to the same antidepressant. For example, a particular drug may work better — or not as well — for you than for another person. Or you may have more, or fewer, side effects from taking a specific antidepressant than someone else does.
 
 Inherited traits play a role in how antidepressants affect you. If you have a close relative who responded to a particular antidepressant, tell your doctor, because this could be a good drug choice to start.
 
 In some cases, results of special blood tests, where available, may offer clues about how your body may respond to a particular antidepressant. However, other variables can affect your response to medication.
 
 When choosing an antidepressant, your doctor takes into account your symptoms, any health problems, other medications you take and what has worked for you in the past.
 
 Typically, it may take several weeks or longer before an antidepressant is fully effective and for initial side effects to ease up. Your doctor may recommend some dose adjustments or different antidepressants, but with patience, you and your doctor can find a medication that works well for you.

1942,1,"Major depression
 Email this page to a friend Print Facebook Twitter Pinterest
 Depression is feeling sad, blue, unhappy, or down in the dumps. Most people feel this way once in a while.
 
 Major depression is a mood disorder. It occurs when feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration get in the way of your life over a long period of time. It also changes how your body works.
 
 Causes
 Health care providers do not know the exact causes of depression. It is believed that chemical changes in the brain are responsible. This may be due to a problem with your genes. Or it may be triggered by certain stressful events. More likely, it is a combination of both.
 
 Some types of depression run in families. Other types occur even if you have no family history of the illness. Anyone can develop depression, including children and teens.
 
 Depression and men
 Depression may be brought on by:

 What Is Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)?
 
 Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is a form of chronic depression. It’s a relatively new diagnosis that combines the two earlier diagnoses dysthymia and chronic major depressive disorder. Like other types of depression, PDD causes continuous feelings of deep sadness and hopelessness. These feelings can affect your mood and behavior as well as physical functions, including appetite and sleep. As a result, people with the disorder often lose interest in doing activities they once enjoyed and have difficulty finishing daily tasks.
 
 These symptoms are seen in all forms of depression. In PDD, however, the symptoms are less severe and longer lasting. They can persist for years and may interfere with school, work, and personal relationships. The chronic nature of PDD can also make it more challenging to cope with the symptoms. However, a combination of medication and talk therapy can be effective in treating PDD.
 
 Symptoms of Persistent Depressive Disorder
 The symptoms of PDD are similar to those of depression. However, the key difference is that PDD is chronic, with symptoms occurring on most days for at least two years. These symptoms include:
 
 persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness
 sleep problems
 low energy
 a change in appetite
 difficulty concentrating
 indecisiveness
 a lack of interest in daily activities
 decreased productivity
 poor self-esteem
 a negative attitude
 avoidance of social activities
 The symptoms of PDD often begin to appear during childhood or adolescence. Children and teens with PDD may appear to be irritable, moody, or pessimistic over an extended period. They may also display behavior problems, poor performance at school, and difficulty interacting with other children in social situations. Their symptoms may come and go over several years, and the severity of them may vary over time.
 
 
 Causes of Persistent Depressive Disorder
 The cause of PDD isn’t known. Certain factors may contribute to the development of the condition. These include:
 
 a chemical imbalance in the brain
 a family history of the condition
 a history of other mental health conditions, such as anxiety or bipolar disorder
 stressful or traumatic life events, such as the loss of a loved one or financial problems
 chronic physical illness, such as heart disease or diabetes
 physical brain trauma, such as a concussion

 Diagnosing Persistent Depressive Disorder
 To make an accurate diagnosis, your doctor will first perform a physical examination. Your doctor will also perform blood tests or other laboratory tests to rule out possible medical conditions that may be causing your symptoms. If there’s no physical explanation for your symptoms, then your doctor may begin to suspect that you have a mental health condition.
 
 Your doctor will ask you certain questions to assess your current mental and emotional state. It’s important to be honest with your doctor about your symptoms. Your responses will help them determine whether you have PDD or another type of mental illness.
 
 Many doctors use the symptoms listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to diagnose PDD. This manual is published by the American Psychiatric Association. The PDD symptoms listed in the DSM-5 include:
 
 a depressed mood almost every day for most of the day
 having a poor appetite or overeating
 difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep
 low energy or fatigue
 low self-esteem
 poor concentration or difficulty making decisions
 feelings of hopelessness
 For adults to be diagnosed with the disorder, they must experience a depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, for two or more years.
 
 For children or teens to be diagnosed with the disorder, they must experience a depressed mood or irritability most of the day, nearly every day, for at least one year.
 
 If your doctor believes you have PDD, they’ll likely refer you to a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment.

 Treating Persistent Depressive Disorder
 Treatment for PDD consists of medication and talk therapy. Medication is believed to be a more effective form of treatment than talk therapy when used alone. However, a combination of medication and talk therapy is often the best course of treatment.
 
 Medications
 PDD can be treated with various types of antidepressants, including:
 
 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft)
 tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline (Elavil) and amoxapine (Asendin)
 serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) and duloxetine (Cymbalta)
 You may need to try different medications and dosages to find an effective solution for you. This requires patience, as many medications take several weeks to take full effect.
 
 Talk to your doctor if you continue to have concerns about your medication. Your doctor may suggest making a change in dosage or medication. Never stop taking your medication as directed without speaking to your doctor first. Stopping treatment suddenly or missing several doses may cause withdrawal-like symptoms and make depressive symptoms worse.
 
 Therapy
 Talk therapy is a beneficial treatment option for many people with PDD. Seeing a therapist can help you learn how to:
 
 express your thoughts and feelings in a healthy way
 cope with your emotions
 adjust to a life challenge or crisis
 identify thoughts, behaviors, and emotions that trigger or aggravate symptoms
 replace negative beliefs with positive ones
 regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life
 set realistic goals for yourself
 Talk therapy can be done individually or in a group. Support groups are ideal for those who wish to share their feelings with others who are experiencing similar problems.
 
 Lifestyle Changes
 PDD is a long-lasting condition, so it’s important to participate actively in your treatment plan. Making certain lifestyle adjustments can complement medical treatments and help ease symptoms. These remedies include:
 
 exercising at least three times per week
 eating a diet that largely consists of natural foods, such as fruits and vegetables
 avoiding drugs and alcohol
 seeing an acupuncturist
 taking certain supplements, including St. John’s wort and fish oil
 practicing yoga, tai chi, or meditation
 writing in a journal
 Long-Term Outlook for People with Persistent Depressive Disorder
 Since PDD is a chronic condition, some people never recover completely. Treatment can help many people manage their symptoms, but it isn’t successful for everyone. Some people may continue to experience severe symptoms that interfere with their personal or professional lives.
 
 Whenever you’re having a difficult time coping with your symptoms, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255. There are people available 24 hours per day, seven days a week to speak with you about any problem you may be having. You can also visit their website for additional help and resources.
 
 Q:
 How can I help someone with persistent depressive disorder?
 
 Anonymous patient
 A:
 The most important thing that someone can do to help the individual who suffers from persistent depressive disorder is to realize that they have an actual illness and are not attempting to be “difficult” in their interactions with you. They may not react to good news or positive life events the way individuals without this disorder would react. You should also encourage them to attend all of their doctor and therapist appointments and take their medications as prescribed.

 Help a family member or friend dealing with depression get treatment and find resources.
 
 By Mayo Clinic Staff
 Helping someone with depression can be a challenge. If someone in your life has depression, you may feel helpless and wonder what to do. Learn how to offer support and understanding and how to help your loved one get the resources to cope with depression. Here's what you can do.
 
 Learn the symptoms of depression
 Depression signs and symptoms vary from person to person. They can include:
 
 Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness
 Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters
 Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports
 Insomnia or sleeping too much
 Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort
 Changes in appetite — reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain
 Anxiety, agitation or restlessness
 Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements
 Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or blaming yourself for things that aren't your responsibility
 Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things
 Frequent or recurrent mention of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide
 Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches
 For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Other people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without knowing why. Children and teens may show depression by being irritable or cranky rather than sad.
 
 Encourage treatment
 People with depression may not recognize or acknowledge that they're depressed. They may not be aware of signs and symptoms of depression, so they may think their feelings are normal.
 
 All too often, people feel ashamed about their depression and mistakenly believe they should be able to overcome it with willpower alone. But depression seldom gets better without treatment and may get worse. With the right treatment approach, the person you care about can get better.
 
 Here's what you can do to help:
 
 Talk to the person about what you've noticed and why you're concerned.
 Explain that depression is a medical condition, not a personal flaw or weakness — and that it usually gets better with treatment.
 Suggest seeking help from a professional — a medical doctor or a mental health provider, such as a licensed counselor or psychologist.
 Offer to help prepare a list of questions to discuss in an initial appointment with a doctor or mental health provider.
 Express your willingness to help by setting up appointments, going along to them and attending family therapy sessions.
 If your loved one's illness is severe or potentially life-threatening, contact a doctor, a hospital or emergency medical services.
 
 Identify warning signs of worsening depression
 Everyone experiences depression differently. Observe your loved one. Learn how depression affects your family member or friend — and learn what to do when it gets worse.
 
 Consider these issues:
 
 What are the typical signs and symptoms of depression in your relative or friend?
 What behaviors or language do you observe when depression is worse?
 What behaviors or language do you observe when he or she is doing well?
 What circumstances trigger episodes of more severe depression?
 What activities are most helpful when depression worsens?
 Worsening depression needs to be treated as soon as possible. Encourage your loved one to work with his or her doctor or mental health provider to come up with a plan for what to do when signs and symptoms reach a certain point. As part of this plan, your loved one may need to:
 
 Contact the doctor to see about adjusting or changing medications
 See a psychotherapist, such as a licensed counselor or psychologist
 Take self-care steps, such as being sure to eat healthy meals, get an appropriate amount of sleep and be physically active
 Understand suicide risk
 People with depression are at an increased risk of suicide. If your loved one is severely depressed, prepare yourself for the possibility that at some point he or she may feel suicidal. Take all signs of suicidal behavior seriously and act immediately.
 
 Take action if necessary:
 
 Talk to the person about your concern. Ask if he or she has been thinking about attempting suicide or has a plan for how to do it. Having an actual plan indicates a higher likelihood of attempting suicide.
 Seek help. Contact the person's doctor, mental health provider or other health care professional. Let other family members or close friends know what's going on.
 Call a suicide hotline number. In the United States, you can reach the toll-free, 24-hour hot line of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) to talk to a trained counselor. Use that same number and press ""1"" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line.
 Make sure the person is in a safe environment. If possible, eliminate things that could be used to attempt suicide. For example, remove or lock up firearms, other weapons and medications.
 Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately if the person is in danger of self-harm or suicide. Make sure someone stays with that person at all times.
 Stay alert for warning signs of suicide
 Learn and stay alert for common warning signs of suicide or suicidal thoughts:
 
 Talking about suicide — for example, making statements such as ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I wish I were dead,"" or ""I wish I hadn't been born""
 Getting the means to attempt suicide, such as buying a gun or stockpiling pills
 Withdrawing from social contact and wanting to be left alone
 Having mood swings, such as being emotionally high one day and deeply discouraged the next
 Being preoccupied with death, dying or violence
 Feeling trapped or hopeless about a situation
 Increasing use of alcohol or drugs
 Changing normal routine, including eating or sleeping patterns
 Doing risky or self-destructive things, such as using drugs or driving recklessly
 Giving away belongings or getting affairs in order when there's no other logical explanation for why this is being done
 Saying goodbye to people as if they won't be seen again
 Developing personality changes or being severely anxious or agitated, particularly when experiencing some of the warning signs listed above
 Provide support
 Remember that your loved one's depression isn't anyone's fault. You can't fix the person's depression — but your support and understanding can help.
 
 What you can do for your loved one:
 
 Encourage sticking with treatment. If your relative or friend is in treatment for depression, help him or her remember to take prescribed medications and to keep appointments.
 Be willing to listen. Let your loved one know that you want to understand how he or she feels. When the person wants to talk, listen carefully, but avoid giving advice or opinions or making judgments. Just listening and being understanding can be a powerful healing tool.
 Give positive reinforcement. People with depression may judge themselves harshly and find fault with everything they do. Remind your loved one about his or her positive qualities and how much the person means to you and others.
 Offer assistance. Your relative or friend may not be able to take care of certain tasks well. Give suggestions about specific tasks you'd be willing to do, or ask if there is a particular task that you could take on.
 Help create a low-stress environment. Creating a regular routine may help a person with depression feel more in control. Offer to make a schedule for meals, medication, physical activity and sleep, and help organize household chores.
 Locate helpful organizations. A number of organizations offer support groups, counseling and other resources for depression. For example, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, employee assistance programs and many faith-based organizations offer help for mental health concerns.
 Encourage participation in spiritual practice, if appropriate. For many people, faith is an important element in recovery from depression — whether it's involvement in an organized religious community or personal spiritual beliefs and practices.
 Make plans together. Ask your loved one to join you on a walk, see a movie with you, or work with you on a hobby or other activity he or she previously enjoyed. But don't try to force the person into doing something.
 What you can do for yourself:
 
 Learn about depression. The better you understand what causes depression, how it affects people and how it can be treated, the better you'll be able to talk to and help the person you care about.
 Take care of yourself. Supporting someone with depression isn't easy. Ask other relatives or friends to help, and take steps to prevent becoming frustrated or burned out. Find your own time for hobbies, physical activity, friends and spiritual renewal.
 Finally, be patient. Depression symptoms do improve with treatment, but it can take time. Finding the best treatment may require trying more than one type of medication or treatment approach. For some people, symptoms quickly improve after starting treatment. For others, it will take longer.

 OVERVIEW
 What is depression?
 Depression is a medical condition that affects your mood and ability to function.
 
 Depressive symptoms include feeling sad, anxious or hopeless. The condition can also cause difficulty with thinking, memory, eating and sleeping. A diagnosis of major depressive disorder (clinical depression) means you have felt sad, low or worthless most days for at least two weeks while also having other symptoms such as sleep problems, loss of interest in activities, or change in appetite.
 
 Without treatment, depression can get worse and last longer. In severe cases, it can lead to self-harm or death. Fortunately, treatments can be very effective in improving symptoms of depression.
 
 How common is depression?
 Depression is common all over the world. Healthcare providers estimate that nearly 7% of American adults have depression every year. More than 16% of U.S. adults — around 1 in 6 — will experience depression in their lifetime.
 
 What are the types of depression?
 Healthcare providers name depression types according to symptoms and causes. These episodes often have no obvious cause. In some people, they can linger much longer than in others for no clear reason.
 
 Types of depression include:
 
 Major depressive disorder (MDD): Major depression (clinical depression) has intense or overwhelming symptoms that last longer than two weeks. These symptoms interfere with everyday life.
 Bipolar depression: People with bipolar disorder have alternating periods of low mood and extremely high-energy (manic) periods. During the low period, they may have depression symptoms such as feeling sad or hopeless or lacking energy.
 Perinatal and postpartum depression: “Perinatal” means around birth. Many people refer to this type as postpartum depression. Perinatal depression can occur during pregnancy and up to one year after having a baby. Symptoms go beyond “the baby blues,” which causes minor sadness, worry or stress.
 Persistent depressive disorder (PDD): PDD is also known as dysthymia. Symptoms of PDD are less severe than major depression. But people experience PDD symptoms for two years or longer.
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a severe form of premenstrual disorder (PMS). It affects women in the days or weeks leading up to their menstrual period.
 Psychotic depression: People with psychotic depression have severe depressive symptoms and delusions or hallucinations. Delusions are beliefs in things that are not based in reality, while hallucinations involve seeing, hearing, or feeling touched by things that aren’t actually there.
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD): Seasonal depression, or seasonal affective disorder, usually starts in late fall and early winter. It often goes away during the spring and summer.
 SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES
 What causes depression?
 Various factors can cause depression:
 
 Brain chemistry: Abnormalities in brain chemical levels may lead to depression.
 Genetics: If you have a relative with depression, you may be more likely to become depressed.
 Life events: Stress, the death of a loved one, upsetting events (trauma), isolation and lack of support can cause depression.
 Medical conditions: Ongoing physical pain and illnesses can cause depression. People often have depression along with conditions like diabetes, cancer and Parkinson’s disease.
 Medication: Some medications have depression as a side effect. Recreational drugs and alcohol can also cause depression or make it worse.
 Personality: People who are easily overwhelmed or have trouble coping may be prone to depression.
 What are the symptoms of depression?
 Depression can affect your emotions, mind and body. Depression symptoms include:
 
 Feeling very sad, hopeless or worried.
 Not enjoying things that used to give you joy.
 Being easily irritated or frustrated.
 Eating too much or too little.
 Changes in how much you sleep.
 Having a difficult time concentrating or remembering things.
 Experiencing physical problems like headache, stomachache or sexual dysfunction.
 Thinking about hurting or killing yourself.
 If you or someone you know has thoughts of hurting themselves, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800.273.8255. This national network of local crisis centers provides free, private emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
 
 DIAGNOSIS AND TESTS
 How is depression syndrome diagnosed?
 Everyone may feel sad or down from time to time. However, clinical depression has more intense symptoms that last two weeks or longer.
 
 To determine whether you have clinical depression, your healthcare provider will ask questions. You may complete a questionnaire and provide a family history. Your healthcare provider may also perform an exam or order lab tests to see if you have another medical condition.
 
 MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT
 How is depression syndrome treated?
 Depression can be serious, but it’s also treatable. Treatment for depression includes:
 
 Self-help: Regular exercise, getting enough sleep, and spending time with people you care about can improve depression symptoms.
 Counseling: Counseling or psychotherapy is talking with a mental health professional. Your counselor helps you address your problems and develop coping skills. Sometimes brief therapy is all you need. Other people continue therapy longer.
 Alternative medicine: People with mild depression or ongoing symptoms can improve their well-being with complementary therapy. Therapy may include massage, acupuncture, hypnosis and biofeedback.
 Medication: Prescription medicine called antidepressants can help change brain chemistry that causes depression. Antidepressants can take a few weeks to have an effect. Some antidepressants have side effects, which often improve with time. If they don’t, talk to your provider. A different medications may work better for you.
 Brain stimulation therapy: Brain stimulation therapy can help people who have severe depression or depression with psychosis. Types of brain stimulation therapy include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).
 PREVENTION
 Who is at risk for depression?
 Depression can affect anyone, no matter their age, gender or circumstances. About 16 million Americans experience depression each year.
 
 Women may experience depression more often than men. And your genetics or other health conditions can increase the likelihood that you’ll have at least one depressive episode in your lifetime.
 
 Can depression be prevented?
 You can help prevent depression by getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet and practicing regular self-care activities such as exercise, meditation and yoga.
 
 If you’ve had depression before, you may be more likely to experience it again. If you have depression symptoms, get help. Care can help you feel better sooner.
 
 OUTLOOK / PROGNOSIS
 What’s the outlook for people with depression?
 Depression can be mild or severe. And it can be brief or long-lasting. It’s important to get help right away.
 
 Without treatment, depression can:
 
 Become worse.
 Increase your chance of other health conditions, like dementia.
 Lead to self-harm or death.
 Return, even after you start to feel better.
 LIVING WITH
 What can I do if I have depression?
 If you have symptoms of depression, see your healthcare provider. They can give you an accurate diagnosis, refer you to a specialist or suggest treatment options.
 
 If you or someone you know is thinking of hurting themselves or taking their own life:
 
 Call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 (TYY: 1-800-799-4TTY (4889).
 Go to the emergency department of your hospital.
 Contact a healthcare provider.
 Speak to a trusted friend, family member or spiritual leader.
 A note from Cleveland Clinic
 
 Depression is a common condition that affects millions of Americans every year. Anyone can experience depression — even if there doesn’t seem to be a reason for it. Causes of depression include difficulties in life, brain chemistry abnormalities, some medications and physical conditions. The good news is that depression is treatable. If you have symptoms of depression, talk to your healthcare provider. The sooner you get help, the sooner you can feel better

 OVERVIEW
 
 Stress, anxiety and depression and its impact on Heart Disease
 Written with: Leo Pozuelo, MD
 
 Department of Psychiatry and Psychology
 
 It is common for you to feel sad or depressed after a heart attack, cardiac surgery or procedure, recent hospitalization, or new diagnosis of heart disease. These emotions may be the result of not knowing what to expect or not being able to do simple tasks without becoming overly tired.
 
 Temporary feelings of sadness are normal, and should gradually go away within a few weeks, as you get back to your normal routine and activities.
 
 Sometimes, however, a depressed mood can prevent you from leading a normal life. When a depressed mood is severe and accompanied by other symptoms that persist every day for 2 or more weeks, treatment is necessary to help you cope and recover.
 
 What is the role of depression in patients with cardiovascular disease?
 Up to 15 percent of patients with cardiovascular disease and up to 20 percent of patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery experience major depression.¹
 
 Studies have shown that mental stress has a negative effect on a person’s heart health. In particular:
 
 Unmanaged stress can lead to high blood pressure, arterial damage, irregular heart rhythms and a weakened immune system.
 Patients with depression have been shown to have increased platelet reactivity, decreased heart variability and increased proinflammatory markers (such as C-reactive protein or CRP), which are all risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
 For people with heart disease, depression can increase the risk of an adverse cardiac event such as a heart attack or blood clots. For people who do not have heart disease, depression can also increase the risk of a heart attack and development of coronary artery disease.
 In one landmark study, the continued presence of depression after recovery increased the risk of death (mortality) to 17 percent within 6 months after a heart attack (versus 3 percent mortality in heart attack patients who didn’t have depression).²
 During recovery from cardiac surgery, depression can intensify pain, worsen fatigue and sluggishness, or cause a person to withdraw into social isolation. Patients who have had CABG and have untreated depression after surgery also have increased morbidity and mortality.
 Patients with heart failure and depression have an increased risk of being readmitted to the hospital, and also have an increased mortality risk.
 Early research findings have indicated there may be genetic factors that increase a patient’s risk of depression and risk of recurrent cardiac events after a heart attack.³
 Patients with heart disease and depression also perceive a poorer health status, as manifested by Quality of Life (QoL) studies. Furthermore, heart disease patients with depression have worse treadmill exercise and medication adherence than that of patients with heart disease who do not have depression.⁴⁻⁵⁻⁶
 Negative lifestyle habits associated with depression – such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, poor diet and lack of social support – interfere with the treatment for heart disease.
 Depression has been proven to be a such a risk factor in cardiac disease that the American Heart Association (AHA) has recommended that all cardiac patients be screened for depression using simple screening questions and an easy-to-administer survey called the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2).⁷
 SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES
 How do I know when to seek help?
 If you’re recovering from heart surgery, a heart attack, or another heart condition, temporary feelings of sadness and a depressed mood are common for the first few weeks.
 
 However, treatment is necessary when depression is severe and accompanied by other symptoms (including withdrawal from activities, not responding when visiting with family and friends, increased negative thoughts and tearfulness).
 
 Without treatment, depression can become worse. For heart patients, depression can contribute to an increased risk of heart attack and coronary disease. Talk to your health care provide who can diagnose and start depression treatment with safe antidepressants. Your health care provider also can refer you to a mental health specialist who can provide other appropriate treatment when necessary.
 
 When depression is negatively affecting your life — such as causing increased difficulties with relationships or performance at work or at home, it is important for you to get help to prevent things from getting worse.
 
 More specific reasons to seek help include:
 
 Your negative feelings, such as low mood or lack of experiencing pleasure, persist daily for 2 weeks or more.
 You find it increasingly difficult to participate in your recovery from heart disease. It is not uncommon for patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation to experience emotional difficulties during their physical recovery. A lack of mental drive or motivation, as well as a lack of confidence may indicate that depression has settled in.
 You have significant difficulty with your daily routine, social activities and/or work.
 You don’t have anyone in whom you can confide. If you don’t have anyone to share your thoughts with, it’s hard to know if what you’re thinking makes sense. Depression also has a tendency to make people more withdrawn and isolated, making it harder to receive social support during difficult times.
 You have suicidal thoughts or feelings. Suicide is an irreversible solution to problems and causes permanent harm not only to yourself, but also to family members and friends. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call your physician or local 24-hour suicide hotline right away, or go to the nearest emergency room for help.
 Depressive disorders result from a mix of factors
 A person’s family history, physical health, state of mind and environment.
 High levels of stress, life transitions, loss and many other factors.
 Imbalances in the chemicals that the body uses to control mood.
 DIAGNOSIS AND TESTS
 How is depression diagnosed?
 The biggest hurdle to diagnosing and treating depression is recognizing that someone is suffering from it. Unfortunately, approximately half of the people who experience depression are never diagnosed or treated for their illness. And not getting treatment can be life-threatening: up to 10 percent of people battling depression commit suicide.
 
 Your health care provider can evaluate your condition by asking you to describe your symptoms. Since patients recovering from a medical illness, hospitalization or surgical procedure experience some common symptoms of depression including fatigue and insomnia,your health care provider will pay attention to these additional symptoms of depression:
 
 Withdrawal from activities
 Lack of reactivity from visits with family and friends Increased negative thoughts
 Tearfulness
 Sometimes, symptoms of depression can be made worse by certain medications, a physical disorder, virus or illness. Your health care provider may perform a physical exam or laboratory tests to determine if there is a physical cause for your depressive symptoms.
 
 Your health care provider will also evaluate your personal and family medical history, as well as any history of drug or alcohol use.
 
 Although there are no specific blood tests used to diagnose depression, there are various screening tools and diagnostic criteria used to make the proper diagnosis.
 
 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended that clinicians ask two screening questions for depression, known as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), including:
 
 Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?
 Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?
 If you answer yes to both of these questions, there is a high likelihood of clinical depression, and your health care provider can provide recommendations to help you get the treatment you need. Your health care provider can also administer the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), a nine-item question list that can better define your depression and guide treatment.
 
 MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT
 How is depression treated?
 How is depression treated?
 There are many treatments for depression. Major depressive disorder may be treated with antidepressants, psychotherapy (supportive counseling or “talk therapy”), or a combination of both. Newer, safer antidepressant medications, such as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have an established safety record and are safe for cardiac patients. The antidepressants sertraline (Zoloft) and citalopram (Celexa) have been the best studied, are effective and safe in patients with heart disease, and also are available in generic forms.
 
 Psychotherapy can increase a person’s social support and help the patient develop more positive thinking patterns. Brief supportive models of talk therapy appear to be the most appropriate for helping the depression that cardiac patients experience.
 
 A healthy lifestyle including regular exercise, proper sleep, a well-balanced diet, as well as relaxation and stress management techniques can help you manage depression. In a recent intervention trial, physical exercise was found to have a significant effect on depression.⁸
 
 Major intervention studies — both pharmacologic (SADHART, CREATE) and psycho-therapeutic (ENRICHD) — have been performed in patients who are clinically depressed after a heart attack. These studies are helping clinicians better understand the link and treatment of depression and heart disease and guide optimal treatments. Patients with a previous history of depression or who are experiencing severe depression can be the best responders to medication intervention.⁹⁻¹⁰⁻¹¹⁻¹²⁻¹³

 Tips for coping with depression
 Get dressed every day.
 Practice stress management and relaxation techniques.
 Get out and walk daily.
 Follow your prescribed exercise regimen.
 Ask your health care provider about a cardiac rehabilitation program.
 Resume hobbies and social activities you enjoy.
 Share your feelings with your spouse, friend or a member of the clergy.
 During your recovery from surgery or a recent hospitalization, visits with friends should be limited to 15 minutes at first. Then, increase the amount of time spent with visitors, depending on how you feel.
 Get a good night’s sleep.
 Eat well-balanced, nutritious meals and follow your prescribed dietary guidelines.
 Ask your health care provider about support groups that may help you cope. Support groups are available for patients who have had heart surgery and their families.
 Don’t use harmful habits to cope, such as smoking, using drugs, drinking excessively or overeating. These harmful habits increase your risk for heart disease and stroke.
 Conclusion
 Early detection and treatment of depression in heart patients are crucial to improve a patient’s quality of life and possibly prevent a recurrent coronary event. When left untreated, depression can worsen heart disease and increase the risk of a heart attack. Safe treatments are available to help you cope with depression and help you manage your heart disease.
 
 The support and involvement of family and friends can be crucial in helping someone who is depressed. Living with a depressed person can be very difficult and stressful on family members and friends.
 
 Tips for Family
 Here are some suggestions for living with a depressed person that may make things easier for you and more beneficial for the depressed person:
 
 Encourage the depressed person to seek professional help. Make sure an assessment is done by a trained mental health professional so the proper diagnosis and treatment can be initiated without delay.
 Educate yourself and your family about depression so you can understand what your family member is experiencing. There are many organizations and support groups that can provide more information.
 Know that depression is a disorder with biological, psychological, and interpersonal components; it is not a personal weakness or failure.
 Help your family member follow the prescribed treatment plan and practice the coping techniques and problem-solving skills he or she is learning during psychotherapy.
 Make sure medications are available if prescribed, attend therapy sessions with your family member if needed, encourage the patient to follow recommended lifestyle changes and follow up with the proper health care providers.
 Recognize that depression is often expressed as hostility, rejection and irritability. Offer consistent support to your loved one. This can be draining, but it is one of the most important parts of a treatment plan. People with depression can feel alone and isolated. Giving consistent support and understanding are critical.
 Adopt an interaction style that puts the depressed person in charge. For example, instead of suggesting, “Let’s go to the movies tonight,” try this: “I’d like to see a movie tonight. Which one of these do you want to see with me?” Remember that treatment is effective and your loved one will start to improve in 2 to 3 weeks, achieving full improvement in a couple of months. Notice and praise any significant improvement.
 Reward your family member with opportunities such as visiting friends or going out for activities. Don’t force these, though.
 Take breaks from the depressed person from time to time. It will help both of you.
 Consider family or marital therapy: these forms of therapy bring together all those affected by depression and help them learn effective ways to cope together.
 Consider support from community support groups, either for the depressed person, or for you as the family member.

",,
1947,0,"I just started taking an MAOI for depression. Do I really need to follow a low-tyramine diet?
 Answer From Daniel K. Hall-Flavin, M.D.
 Tyramine (TIE-ruh-meen) is an amino acid that helps regulate blood pressure. It occurs naturally in the body, and it's found in certain foods. Medications called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) block monoamine oxidase, which is an enzyme that breaks down excess tyramine in the body. Blocking this enzyme helps relieve depression.
 
 If you take an MAOI and you eat high-tyramine foods, tyramine can quickly reach dangerous levels. This can cause a serious spike in blood pressure and require emergency treatment.
 
 Avoid consuming foods that are high in tyramine if you take an MAOI. You may need to continue following a low-tyramine diet for a few weeks after you stop the medication.
 
 Tyramine occurs naturally in small amounts in protein-containing foods. As these foods age, the tyramine levels increase. Tyramine amounts can vary among foods due to different processing, storage and preparation methods. You can't reduce the amount of tyramine in a food by cooking it.
 
 Examples of foods high in tyramine include:
 
 Strong or aged cheeses, such as aged cheddar, Swiss and Parmesan; blue cheeses such as Stilton and Gorgonzola; and Camembert. Cheeses made from pasteurized milk are less likely to contain high levels of tyramine — for example, American cheese, cottage cheese, ricotta, farmer cheese and cream cheese.
 Cured meats, which are meats treated with salt and nitrate or nitrite, such as dry-type summer sausages, pepperoni and salami.
 Smoked or processed meats, such as hot dogs, bologna, bacon, corned beef or smoked fish.
 Pickled or fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, caviar, tofu or pickles.
 Sauces, such as soy sauce, shrimp sauce, fish sauce, miso and teriyaki sauce.
 Soybeans and soybean products.
 Snow peas, broad beans (fava beans) and their pods.
 Dried or overripe fruits, such as raisins or prunes, or overripe bananas or avocados.
 Meat tenderizers or meat prepared with tenderizers.
 Yeast-extract spreads, such as Marmite, brewer's yeast or sourdough bread.
 Alcoholic beverages, such as beer — especially tap or homebrewed beer — red wine, sherry and liqueurs.
 Combination foods that contain any of the above ingredients.
 Improperly stored foods or spoiled foods. While you're taking an MAOI, your doctor may recommend eating only fresh foods — not leftovers or foods past their freshness dates.
 Beverages with caffeine also may contain tyramine, so your doctor may recommend limits.
 
 MAOIs, although effective, generally have been replaced by newer antidepressants that are safer and cause fewer side effects. Still, an MAOI is a good option for some people. In certain cases, an MAOI relieves depression when other treatments have failed.
 
 Examples of MAOIs that are used for depression include:
 
 Isocarboxazid (Marplan)
 Phenelzine (Nardil)
 Selegiline (Emsam)
 Tranylcypromine (Parnate)
 Selegiline in patch form (Emsam) delivers the medication through your skin. If you use the lowest dose of the patch, you may not need to be as strict with the foods you eat, but check with your doctor or pharmacist.
 
 It's wise to learn the emergency signs of a rapid and severe rise in blood pressure (hypertensive crisis), which may include:
 
 Severe headache
 Nausea and vomiting
 Sweating and severe anxiety
 Nosebleeds
 Fast heartbeat
 Chest pain
 Changes in vision
 Shortness of breath
 Confusion
 Rarely, a severe increase in blood pressure can lead to bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).
 
 If you take an MAOI, be prepared. Ask your doctor:
 
 For a list of foods to avoid — make sure you understand exactly what's safe for you and what isn't
 What to do if you accidently eat or drink something with too much tyramine, so you have a plan in place

1948,0,"What is a depressive disorder?
 A depressive disorder is a medical condition that causes feelings of sadness or hopelessness that do not go away. These feelings last longer than usual. It is more than feeling down in the dumps. Depressive disorders cause you to lose interest in things and sometimes the people you used to enjoy. These feelings interfere with your daily life. A depressive disorder can be treated.
 
 What are the signs and symptoms of a depressive disorder?
 Appetite changes, or weight gain or loss
 Trouble going to sleep or staying asleep, or sleeping too much
 Waking up earlier than usual and not being able to go back to sleep
 Lack of energy, motivation, or interest in enjoyable activities
 Feeling restless, irritable, or withdrawn
 Feeling worthless, hopeless, discouraged, or guilty
 Trouble concentrating, remembering things, doing daily tasks, or making decisions
 Thoughts of self-harm, suicide, or your own death
 What causes or increases my risk for a depressive disorder?
 A depressive disorder may be caused by changes in brain chemicals that affect your mood. Your risk for a depressive disorder may be higher with any of the following:
 
 Stressful events such as the death of a loved one, abuse, parents' divorce, or loss of a friendship
 Parents, siblings, or other family members with a history of depression
 An anxiety disorder, ADHD, or a learning disability
 Low self-esteem or poor relationships with others
 Being bullied
 Drug or alcohol abuse
 How is a depressive disorder diagnosed?
 Your healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms and how long you have had them. He or she will ask if you have any family members with depression. Tell your healthcare provider about any stressful events in your life. He or she may ask about any other health conditions or medicines you take. Your healthcare provider may ask how your symptoms are affecting your relationships at home, school, and work.
 
 
 How is a depressive disorder treated?
 A depressive disorder can be treated. Treatment can help you feel better.
 
 Mental health therapies may be needed. Your healthcare provider may recommend:
 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you create more realistic, appropriate thoughts about yourself and your behaviors. You may work individually with a mental health provider. CBT may also be done with a group of adolescents that have a depressive disorder. CBT may be combined with medicines that help treat your depressive disorder.
 Interpersonal therapy (IPT) helps you connect to other people by understanding their feelings and views. IPT also helps you communicate better with friends and family members.
 Antidepressant medicine may be given to improve or balance your mood. You may need to take this medicine for several weeks before you begin to feel better. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effects or problems you have with your medicine. The type or amount of medicine may need to be changed.
 What else can I do?
 Do not wait for your feelings to go away. Help is available.
 
 Talk to your parent or an adult. If you feel like you cannot talk to your parents, talk to a school nurse or counselor. Tell someone about your feelings and thoughts. Tell him or her if you feel like you might harm yourself. Tell him or her if you are being bullied by someone.
 Talk with your friends. Your friends can listen and understand how you feel. Your friends can support you.
 Contact a crisis hotline. Call the crisis hotline at 1-800-273-8255. Text ""GO"" to 741741 if you do not feel comfortable talking to someone you know. There are many crisis hotlines with someone available to help you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Find the number for a hotline in your area and keep it with you at all times.
 What can I do to help improve my mood?
 Eat healthy foods.
 Do physical activity every day, such as walking or running.
 Get out in the daylight.
 Get enough sleep.
 Focus on positive things, even the small things.
 Keep a journal.
 Use music or art to be creative.
 Hang out with positive people.
 Do not use alcohol or drugs.
 Call your local emergency number (911 in the US) if:
 You feel like you could harm yourself or someone else.
 When should I or someone close to me call my therapist or doctor?
 Your symptoms do not improve.
 You cannot make it to your next appointment.

 When to talk with a doctor
 What’s next?
 We all feel sad sometimes. But if you’ve been feeling very low for more than two weeks, you may be experiencing depression.
 
 Sadness, anger, and tiredness are all natural human emotions. We’re usually able to manage these feelings, and they don’t tend to get in the way of our lives too much.
 
 Depression, on the other hand, is a serious condition that affects your mental and physical health. It affects your mood, how you see yourself, and even your eating and sleeping habits.
 
 Depression is a mental health condition that lasts two weeks or more in which you feel sad, emotionally sensitive, hopeless, or uninterested in things that you usually love.
 
 The good news is that depression is treatable, and help is available. Lots of treatments can help, including therapy, self-care, and in some cases, antidepressants.
 
 What is depression?
 Depression is a widespread mental health disorder. So if you have it, you’re definitely not alone.
 
 In fact, depression is one of the leading causes of disability in the United States and worldwide. It affects around 264 million peopleTrusted Source globally and 17.3 million adults in the United States.
 
 Other names for depression include major depressive disorder, major depression, and clinical depression.
 
 We all feel sad or lonely from time to time. That’s part of being human.
 
 But if you feel low or hopeless often — like almost daily — it might be depression. This is especially true if you’ve been experiencing symptoms for 2 weeks or longer.
 
 You might not know what’s causing these lingering symptoms. You might not even know when they began. All you know is that you just haven’t felt like yourself in a while.
 
 “Depression is something that doesn’t have much to do with outside circumstances,” says Rachelle Heinemann, a licensed mental health counselor in Brooklyn, New York. “There doesn’t seem to be a reason for it.”
 
 In other cases, depression has an identifiable cause. A stressful life event, such as a sudden loss or a relationship change, might trigger low moods.
 
 If these moods last a long time or are relatively severe, this might be considered depression, especially in someone who has a history of depressive episodes.
 
 The loss of a loved one, or even the ending of a relationship, can lead to deep feelings of sadness or grief, but those feelings aren’t the same as having depression.
 
 The grieving process tends to go in waves: Some moments, you might have positive memories or feel OK. Other times, you’ll feel down or lose interest in things you once loved. You also don’t usually suffer from low self-esteem or self-loathing during grief — but those are common symptoms of depression.
 
 However, grief can lead to complicated grief or depression, especially if you find it difficult to move on from the loss.
 
 Want to learn more? You can read about the stages of grief and mourning here.
 
 Are there different kinds of depression?
 Yes. Depression isn’t a one-size-fits-all.
 
 “Many people with depression don’t even know they have it,” says Adrienne Meier, a clinical psychologist and telehealth practitioner. “Symptoms are often misattributed to fatigue or stress or even just ‘getting older.'”
 
 These are different kinds of depression:
 
 Persistent depressive disorder (Dysthymia): This condition is not as intense, but it drags on for two years or longer.
 Depressive psychosis: This is a combination of severe depression and delusions or hallucinations.
 Bipolar disorder: You alternate between periods of high energy and risky behavior (mania) and severe depression in which you find it difficult to cope.
 Atypical depression: You might feel better for short periods in response to positive events. It can start earlier in life and last a long time.
 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): This condition causes severe irritability, depression, or anxiety during the time between ovulation and your period.
 Seasonal affective disorder: Most common in winter or regions where the days are particularly short in fall and winter. It’s believed to be caused by changes in circadian rhythms, serotonin, and melatonin in response to reduced light exposure.
 Situational depression (or adjustment disorder): Begins with a stressful life event, such as a death, move, or family change. It usually begins within 3 months of the event and tends to resolve within 6 months.
 Postpartum depression: Occurs during pregnancy or within 12 months of giving birth. It usually coincides with the hormonal and physical changes that come with parenthood.
 Major depression: Also known as clinical depression, this is the most common kind of depression (and the focus of this article).

 What are the symptoms of major depression?
 Major depression can cause a range of symptoms that last 2 weeks or longer.
 
 Depression appears differently for each person, and its symptoms are not always consistent or clear-cut. You don’t need to experience all of the following to receive a diagnosis of depression, but it usually involves a combination of these symptoms:
 
 Persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness
 “[Depression] feels deeper than sadness,” Heinemann says.
 
 You might find yourself wondering what’s the point of getting up, or you might cry more easily.
 
 Some people with depression say that it feels as if they’ve sunk into a deep, dark hole with no way out, and they have little to no hope that things will ever change.
 
 Others feel worthless or guilty. You might find yourself dwelling on things you wish you could have done differently.
 
 Or, you might not like yourself much right now. Self-loathing is a frequent symptom.
 
 You’re less interested in things you usually enjoy
 “Someone struggling [with depression] might lose interest in doing the things they used to be passionate about,” Heinemann says.
 
 For example, if you used to lovegoing for walks, playing sports, or painting, but now you dread the idea of doing any of those things, that’s a big red flag for depression.
 
 Depression can also impact your desire for sex, according to research.
 
 You find it hard to concentrate, get things done, or take care of yourself
 “Often those suffering from depression describe it as a weight on top of them, suffocating them, making it impossible to get out of bed or take care of their basic needs,” says Heinemann. “They feel drowned by depression.”
 
 This can feel like being really low on energy.
 
 “Some people find it difficult to do things like showering or brushing their teeth,” she says.
 
 Others struggle with simple chores or concentrating at work. Even making decisions can feel difficult if you have depression.
 
 “Depression tends to hijack our brain, so the strategies we usually use or rely on [to get things done] aren’t helpful because our brains are lying to us,” explains Meier. “We are seeing the world through poop-covered glasses.”
 
 You feel irritable
 Research suggests that irritability is a symptom that’s most common in males, but it can affect anyone. Irritability and aggression are also common signs of depression in children.
 
 So if you find yourself prone to anger, aggressiveness, or feel as if everyone around you is irritating, this could signal depression.
 
 Your sleep patterns have changed
 You might feel tired all the time and find yourself sleeping a lot more than usual. Or you might find it difficult to sleep even when you’re tired, so you spend long nights awake in bed.
 
 But research suggests that most peopleTrusted Source experience some sleep disturbance when they have depression.
 
 Your appetite has changed
 As with sleep, depression affects people’s appetites differently. Some people are hungry or feel the urge to eat all the time. Others don’t feel like eating at all.
 
 Changes in your appetite can affect your weight, too — and quickly. For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) says that depression can lead to weight gain or loss of more than 5% of your body weight in a month.
 
 You feel anxious
 Depression doesn’t really cause anxiety, but a lot of people experience both conditions at the same time. So you might feel nervous, restless, or worried a lot. Your heart rate or breathing might change when you start to worry, or you might feel twitchy.
 
 Feeling anxious? Here are 9 ways that can help to relieve anxiety right away.
 
 Your body aches
 For some people, depression causes physical symptoms like aches, pains and lots of headaches or migrainesTrusted Source. Other people might be more sensitive to pain than usual.
 
 For example, one study found that some people with mental health disorders — including major depression — had migraine attacks that preceded them.
 
 You think about self-harm or suicide
 This is the most serious symptom of depression — even if your thoughts of death or suicide are fleeting and don’t involve plans to follow through.
 
 Some people have death ideation, which means feeling as if you don’t want to be alive anymore but don’t intend or have thoughts about self-harm or suicide.
 
 If you or someone you know is considering suicide, you’re not alone. Help is available right now:
 
 Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24 hours a day at 800-273-8255.

 What causes it?
 Sometimes, people become depressed due to difficulties coping with many things over a period of time. Many find that work stress, relationship problems, and other issues accumulate over time.
 
 Life events or major life changes, like moving away, can also cause depression and related conditions.
 
 Feeling a lack of meaning or purpose can be one of the most common causes of depression, especially when you lose contact with activities that provide a sense of meaning, purpose, or sense of self.
 
 A number of things that can cause or contribute to depression, including:
 
 Brain structure: Research suggests that the hippocampus is smaller in some people with depression. A less active frontal lobe could also cause it.
 Biochemistry: Differences in certain brain chemicals could contribute to depression.
 Family history: You are more likely to have depression if depression or another mental health condition runs in your family.
 Trauma: Stressful or traumatic events can impact how your body reacts to fear and stress in the future, which raises your risk of depression. This is especially trueTrusted Source for childhood trauma.
 Medical conditions: Chronic illness or pain, insomnia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are some of the conditions that could put you at a higher risk of developing depression.
 Environmental factors: Exposure to abuse, violence, poverty, or trauma could make you more vulnerable to depression.
 How is depression diagnosed?
 If you are noticing the symptoms of depression, a healthcare professional can help get you a diagnosis.
 
 This will likely begin with a conversation and a physical examination. Your doctor will likely ask you about your family history to see if depression or other mental health conditions run in your family.
 
 If you’re talking with your primary physician, they might also order blood tests to ensure that another medical condition isn’t the cause of your symptoms. For example, the fatigue or lethargy you can feel with depression could also be caused by vitamin deficienciesTrusted Source or a thyroid issue.
 
 If your doctor can’t find another cause for your symptoms, they will likely refer you to a licensed mental health expert who will evaluate your mood, behavior, and day-to-day activities.
 
 They will also ask you about your family’s psychological history. They may use a depression-rating questionnaire, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), to diagnose the condition.
 
 According to the DSM-5, you have to display at least five of the main symptoms of depression for over two weeks to get a diagnosis.
 
 
 When to talk with a doctor
 If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, it’s always best to talk with a healthcare professional, especially since some symptoms can be caused by underlying medical conditions rather than depression. The sooner you talk with them, the sooner you can get the help you need to start feeling better.
 
 It’s OK if you’re feeling reluctant to talk to a mental health expert or doctor, but you have nothing to be ashamed of. It’s OK to ask for help. If you’re not comfortable sharing, then no one except you and your doctor has to know that you’re seeking treatment.
 
 “We go to a doctor when our body isn’t feeling well, and we go to a therapist when our emotions feel out of whack,” says Heinemann. “Depression is not your fault, nor is it something you can just snap out of.”
 
 What’s next?
 Once you receive a diagnosis of depression, your mental health professional will discuss possible treatments for depression with you, including one or a combination of the following:
 
 Antidepressants: These can help you begin to see improvement in your symptoms within a few weeks, though it could be a couple of months before you truly begin to feel better.
 Psychotherapy: Better known as talk therapy, psychotherapy can help you learn to problem-solve and recognize negative thinking. Your therapist can also help you maximize meaningful behaviors and activities during your week. This helps many people cope with challenges in a more adaptive way.
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): This is reserved for people with the most severe kinds of depression who haven’t responded to other treatments. This is a safe and effective treatment.
 Feeling better will be a process: It won’t happen overnight. But with time, you’ll notice an improvement in the way that you feel.

 Where to get help
 
 While we all feel sad, moody or low from time to time, some people experience these feelings intensely, for long periods of time (weeks, months or even years) and sometimes without any apparent reason. Depression is more than just a low mood – it's a serious condition that has an impact on both physical and mental health. 
 
 Depression is common
 In any one year, around one million people in Australia experience depression. One in six women and one in eight men will experience depression at some time in their life. The good news is, depression is treatable and effective treatments are available. The sooner a person with depression seeks support, the sooner they can recover.
 
 Symptoms of depression
 Depression affects how people think, feel and act. Depression makes it more difficult to manage from day to day and interferes with study, work and relationships. A person may be depressed if for more than two weeks they have felt sad, down or miserable most of the time or have lost interest or pleasure in most of their usual activities, and have also experienced several of the signs and symptoms across at least three of the categories in the list below. It’s important to note, everyone experiences some of these symptoms from time to time and it may not necessarily mean a person is depressed. Equally, not every person who is experiencing depression will have all of these symptoms.  
 
 Feelings caused by depression
 A person with depression may feel:
 
 sad 
 miserable
 unhappy
 irritable
 overwhelmed
 guilty
 frustrated
 lacking in confidence
 indecisive
 unable to concentrate
 disappointed.
 Thoughts caused by depression
 A person with depression may have thoughts such as:
 
 ‘I’m a failure.’
 ‘It’s my fault.’
 ‘Nothing good ever happens to me.’
 ‘I’m worthless.’
 ‘There is nothing good in my life.’
 ‘Things will never change.’
 ‘Life’s not worth living.’
 ‘People would be better off without me.’
 Behavioural symptoms of depression
 A person with depression may:
 
 withdraw from close family and friends
 stop going out
 stop their usual enjoyable activities
 not get things done at work or school
 rely on alcohol and sedatives.
 Physical symptoms of depression
 A person with depression may experience:
 
 being tired all the time
 feeling sick and ‘run down’
 frequent headaches, stomach or muscle pains
 a churning gut
 sleep problems
 loss or change of appetite
 significant weight loss or gain.
 Causes of depression
 While the exact cause of depression isn’t known, a number of things can be associated with its development. Generally, depression does not result from a single event, but from a combination of biological, psychological, social and lifestyle factors.
 
 Personal factors that can lead to depression
 Personal factors that can lead to a risk of depression include:
 
 family history – depression can run in families and some people will be at an increased genetic risk. However, this doesn’t mean that a person will automatically experience depression if a parent or close relative has had the condition.
 personality – some people may be more at risk because of their personality, particularly if they tend to worry a lot, have low self-esteem, are perfectionists, are sensitive to personal criticism, or are self-critical and negative
 serious medical conditions – these can trigger depression in two ways. Serious conditions can bring about depression directly or can contribute to depression through the associated stress and worry, especially if it involves long-term management of a condition or chronic pain
 drug and alcohol use – can both lead to and result from depression. Many people with depression also have drug and alcohol problems. 
 Life events and depression
 Research suggests that continuing difficulties, such as long-term unemployment, living in an abusive or uncaring relationship, long-term isolation or loneliness or prolonged exposure to stress at work can increase the risk of depression. 
 
 Significant adverse life events, such as losing a job, going through a separation or divorce, or being diagnosed with a serious illness, may also trigger depression, particularly among people who are already at risk because of genetic, developmental or other personal factors.
 
 Changes in the brain
 Although there has been a lot of research in this complex area, there is still much that we do not know. Depression is not simply the result of a chemical imbalance, for example because a person has too much or not enough of a particular brain chemical. However, disturbances in normal chemical messaging processes between nerve cells in the brain are believed to contribute to depression. 
 
 Some factors that can lead to faulty mood regulation in the brain include:
 
 genetic vulnerability
 severe life stressors
 taking some medications, drugs and alcohol
 some medical conditions.
 Most modern antidepressants have an effect on the brain’s chemical transmitters, in particular serotonin and noradrenaline, which relay messages between brain cells. This is thought to be how medications work for depression. 
 
 Other medical treatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may sometimes be recommended for people with severe depression who have not recovered with lifestyle change, social support, psychological therapy and medication. While these treatments also have an impact on the brain’s chemical messaging process between nerve cells, the precise ways in which these treatments work is still being researched.  
 
 Seek support for symptoms of depression
 Depression is often not recognised and can go on for months or even years if left untreated. It’s important to seek support as early as possible, as the sooner a person gets treatment, the sooner they can recover. 
 
 Untreated depression can have many negative effects on a person’s life, including serious relationship and family problems, difficulty finding and holding down a job, and drug and alcohol problems. 
 
 There is no one proven way that people recover from depression. However, there is a range of effective treatments and health professionals who can help people on the road to recovery. 
 
 There are also many things that people with depression can do for themselves to help them recover and stay well. The important thing is to find the right treatment and the right health professional for a person’s needs.
 
 Types of depression
 There are different types of depression. The symptoms for each can range from relatively minor through to severe. 
 
 Major depression
 Major depression, or major depressive disorder is the technical term used by health professionals and researchers to describe the most common type of depression. Other terms sometimes used include unipolar depression or clinical depression. 
 
 Depression can be described as mild, moderate or severe.
 
 Melancholia
 Melancholia is an older term for depression and is still sometimes used to describe a more severe form of depression with a strong biological basis, where many of the physical symptoms of depression are particularly evident. For example, one of the major changes is that the person can be observed to move more slowly, or to be experiencing significant changes to their sleep pattern and appetite. 
 
 A person with melancholia is also more likely to have a depressed mood that is characterised by complete loss of pleasure in everything or almost everything.
 
 Dysthymia
 The symptoms of dysthymia (sometimes called Persistent Depressive Disorder) are similar to those of major depression, but are less severe and more persistent. A person has to have this milder depression for more than two years to be diagnosed with dysthymia.
 
 Psychotic depression
 Sometimes, people with a depressive condition can lose touch with reality. This can involve hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there) or delusions (false beliefs that are not shared by others), such as believing they are bad or evil, or that they are being watched or followed or that everyone is against them. This is known as psychotic depression.
 
 Antenatal and postnatal depression
 Women are at an increased risk of depression during pregnancy (known as the antenatal or prenatal period) and in the year following childbirth (known as the postnatal period). This time frame (the period covered by pregnancy and the first year after the baby’s birth) may also be referred to as the perinatal period.
 
 The causes of depression at this time can be complex and are often the result of a combination of factors. In the days immediately following birth, many women experience the ‘baby blues’, which is a common condition related to hormonal changes, affecting up to 80 per cent of women who have given birth. 
 
 The ‘baby blues’, or the general stress of adjusting to pregnancy or a new baby, are common experiences, but are different from depression. 
 
 Depression is longer lasting and can affect not only the mother, but her relationship with her baby, the child’s development, the mother’s relationship with her partner and with other members of the family.
 
 Up to one in 10 women will experience depression during pregnancy. This increases to 16 per cent in the first three months after having a baby.
 
 Bipolar disorder
 Bipolar disorder used to be known as ‘manic depression’ because the person experiences periods of depression and periods of mania with periods of normal mood in between. The symptoms of mania are opposite to the symptoms of depression and can vary in intensity. They include:
 
 feeling great
 having plenty of energy
 racing thoughts
 little need for sleep
 talking fast
 having difficulty focusing on tasks
 feeling frustrated and irritable. 
 This is not just a fleeting experience. Sometimes, the person loses touch with reality and experiences hallucinations or delusions, particularly about their ideas, abilities or importance. A family history of bipolar disorder can increase a person’s risk of experiencing bipolar disorder. 
 
 Because bipolar disorder includes periods of depression, it is not uncommon for a person with bipolar disorder to be misdiagnosed as having major depression until they have a manic or hypomanic episode. Bipolar disorder can also sometimes be confused with other mental health conditions such as schizophrenia. 
 
 The treatment for bipolar disorder is often different to that for major depression. It is therefore important to check for this condition whenever a person is being assessed for depression. 
 
 Cyclothymic disorder
 Cyclothymic disorder is an uncommon condition which is often described as a milder form of bipolar disorder. The person experiences chronic fluctuating moods over at least two years, involving periods of hypomania (a mild to moderate level of mania) and periods of depressive symptoms, with very short periods (no more than two months) of normality between. 
 
 The symptoms last for a shorter time, are less severe, and are not as regular, so they don’t fit the criteria of bipolar disorder or major depression.
 
 Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
 SAD is a mood disorder that has a seasonal pattern. The cause is unclear, but may be related to the variation in light exposure in different seasons. SAD is characterised by mood disturbances (either periods of depression or mania) that begin and end in a particular season. Depression in winter only is the most common way in which people experience SAD. 
 
 SAD is usually diagnosed after the person has had the same symptoms during winter for two or more years. People with SAD are more likely to experience lack of energy, sleep too much, overeat, gain weight and crave carbohydrates. 
 
 SAD is rare in Australia, and more likely to be found in countries with short days and longer periods of darkness, such as the cold climate in the Northern Hemisphere.

1951,0,"What is a depressive disorder?
 A depressive disorder is a medical condition. It is normal for your child to feel sad, irritable, or hopeless sometimes. A depressive disorder is a condition that causes your child to have these feelings for weeks, months, or longer. Your child's feelings may interfere with his or her normal activities. You may feel that your child is being disrespectful or has a bad attitude.
 
 What are common signs and symptoms of depressive disorder?
 Signs of a depressive disorder are seen almost daily. Your child may have any of the following:
 
 Change in appetite, weight loss, or weight gain
 Sleeps too much or not enough
 Wakes up earlier than usual and is not able to get back to sleep
 Irritable or angry mood, restlessness, or anxiety
 Lack of interest and concentration in enjoyable activities and schoolwork
 Low energy or fatigue
 Withdrawn from family and friends
 Feelings of guilt and worthlessness
 What increases my child's risk for a depressive disorder?
 Stressful events such as the death of a loved one, abuse, parents' divorce, or loss of a friendship
 Parents, siblings, or other family members with a history of depression
 An anxiety disorder, ADHD, or a learning disability
 Low self-esteem or poor relationships with others
 Being bullied
 Drug or alcohol abuse
 How is a depressive disorder diagnosed?
 Your child's healthcare provider will ask about signs that you or others, such as teachers have noticed. Tell your child's healthcare provider how long you have noticed the signs. He or she will ask if there are any family members with depression. Tell your child's healthcare provider about any stressful events in your child's life. He or she may ask about any other health conditions or medicines your child takes. Your child's healthcare provider may ask how the symptoms are affecting your child's relationships at home, school, and work.
 
 
 How is a depressive disorder treated?
 A depressive disorder can be treated. Treatment can help your child feel better.
 
 Mental health therapies may be needed. Your child's healthcare provider may recommend:
 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps your child create more realistic, appropriate thoughts about his or her behaviors and self. Your child may work individually with a mental health provider. CBT may also be done with a group of children that have a depressive disorder. CBT may be combined with medicines that help treat your child's depressive disorder.
 Interpersonal therapy (IPT) helps your child connect to other people by understanding other's feelings and views. IPT also helps your child communicate better with friends and family members.
 Antidepressant medicine may be given to improve or balance your child's mood. Your child may need to take this medicine for several weeks before he or she begins to feel better. Tell your child's healthcare provider about any side effects or problems your child has with the medicine. The type or amount of medicine may need to be changed.
 What can I do to help my child?
 Talk to your child about his or her mood. Your child may ignore you or deny that there is anything wrong. Talk to your child anyway.
 Be patient with your child. Do not become angry because of your child's irritable or grumpy mood.
 Spend time with your child. Play a game, watch a movie, cook, or make a craft with your child. Encourage positive moods, enjoyment, and relaxation in your child by spending time with him or her.
 Take your child to all appointments. A depressive disorder is treatable with the correct help. Your child can feel better with treatment.
 Encourage healthy eating and sleeping habits. Make sure your child eats a variety of healthy foods. Stick to a sleep schedule so he gets enough sleep. Your child may sleep better if his or her room is quiet and dark.
 Make sure your child gets 1 hour of physical activity every day. Encourage your child to play sports or be active every day. You and your child can take a walk. Physical activity can reduce symptoms of depression.
 Call your local emergency number (911 in the US) for any of the following:
 Your child has done something on purpose to hurt himself or herself.
 Your child talks about or tries to commit suicide.
 When should I call my child's therapist or doctor?
 Your child's symptoms do not improve.
 You cannot take your child to his or her next appointment.
 Your child has new symptoms.
 You have questions or concerns about your child's condition or care.

 By Jennifer Rainey
 Medically Reviewed by Smitha Bhandari, MD on September 12, 2020
 
 
 IN THIS ARTICLE
 Warning Signs
 How to Help
 Suicide is one of the top causes of death in the U.S., with rates rising across the country. Nearly 45,000 Americans died by suicide in 2016, according to the CDC.
 
 Suicide can be preventable. And that starts with knowing what to look for and what to do.
 
 If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255). It’s always open, and you can speak to a trained counselor.
 
 If someone is threatening to kill themselves, don’t leave them alone. Call 911 or, if you can do it safely, take them to the nearest emergency room. Try to keep the person calm, and get help from others.
 
  
 
 Warning Signs
 People who commit suicide don’t want to die, but to end their pain. Don’t dismiss their talk of suicide as just threats. If you notice any signs that they may be thinking about harming themselves, get help.
 
 Focuses on death. Some people talk openly about wanting to die or to commit suicide. Or they dwell on the topic of death and dying. They may research ways to kill themselves or buy a gun, knife, or pills.
 
 Makes plans. The person may take steps to prepare for death, like updating a will, giving away stuff, and saying goodbye to others. Some may write a suicide note.
 
 
 Becomes withdrawn. The person avoids close friends and family, loses interest in activities and social events, and becomes isolated.
 
 Shows despair. The person may talk openly about unbearable pain, or feeling like they’re a burden on others.
 
 Shows swings in mood or sleep. Often, the person may be depressed, anxious, sad, or angry. They also may be very irritable, moody, or aggressive. But they can suddenly turn calm once they’ve decided to go through with the suicide. Then they may sleep a lot more or a lot less than usual.
 
 Drinks or takes drugs. Substance misuse raises the chance of suicide. Using a lot of drugs and alcohol may be an attempt to dull the pain or to harm themselves.
 
 
 Acts recklessly. The person may take dangerous chances, like driving drunk or having risky sex.
 
 People may also be at risk if they have:
 
 Mental disorders
 Addictions to alcohol or other drugs
 A serious physical illness
 A major loss (such as the death of a loved one or the loss of a relationship or job)
 Serious legal or financial problems
 A history of trauma or abuse
 How to Help
 Take all suicide warning signs seriously. Your involvement and support may help save a life.
 
 Don’t be afraid to ask whether the person you’re concerned about is thinking of suicide, is depressed, or has problems. Talking about it won’t make the person act on their feelings. It might actually help ease suicidal thoughts -- and lets you know if you need to take further action.
 
 Encourage the person to talk to a mental health professional as soon as possible. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is always open. You can reach a trained counselor at 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255).

 Takeaway
 ADHD and depression
 
 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It can affect your emotions, behavior, and ways of learning. People with ADHD are often diagnosed as children, and many continue to show symptoms into adulthood. If you have ADHD, you can take steps to manage it. Your doctor may prescribe medications, behavioral therapy, counseling, or other treatments.
 
 A disproportionate number of children and adults with ADHD also experience depression. For example, researchers from the University of Chicago have found that adolescents with ADHD are 10 times more likely to develop depression than those without ADHD. Depression can also affect adults with ADHD.
 
 If you suspect you have ADHD, depression, or both, make an appointment with your doctor. They can help diagnose your symptoms. They can also help you develop a treatment plan that works for you.
 
 What are the symptoms?
 ADHD is an umbrella term for a wide range of symptoms. There are three main types of the condition:
 
 Predominantly inattentive type: You might have this type of ADHD if you have trouble paying attention, struggle to organize your thoughts, and get distracted easily.
 Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type: You might have this type of ADHD if you frequently feel restless, interrupt or blurt out information, and find it difficult to stay still.
 Combination type: If you have a combination of the two types described above, you have combination type ADHD.
 Depression can also cause a variety of symptoms. Common symptoms include:
 
 persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, emptiness
 frequent feelings of anxiety, irritability, restlessness, or frustration
 loss of interest in things you used to enjoy
 trouble paying attention
 changes in your appetite
 trouble sleeping
 fatigue
 Some of the symptoms of depression overlap with the symptoms of ADHD. This can make it hard to tell the two conditions apart. For example, restlessness and boredom can be symptomatic of both ADHD and depression. In some cases, the medications prescribed for ADHD can also produce side effects that mimic depression. Some ADHD medications can cause:
 
 sleep difficulties
 loss of appetite
 mood swings
 fatigue
 restlessness
 If you suspect you might be depressed, make an appointment with your doctor. They can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms.
 
 What are the risk factors?
 If you have ADHD, a number of risk factors affect your chances of developing depression.
 
 Sex
 You’re more likely to develop ADHD if you’re male. But according to researchers from the University of Chicago, you’re more likely to develop depression with ADHD if you’re female. Females with ADHD have a higher risk of becoming depressed than males.
 
 ADHD type
 The researchers from the University of Chicago also found that people who have predominantly inattentive type ADHD or combined type ADHD are more likely to experience depression than those with the hyperactive-impulsive variety.
 
 Maternal health history
 The mental health status of your mother also affects your chances of developing depression. In an article published in JAMA Psychiatry, scientists reported that women who had depression or serotonin impairment during pregnancy were more likely to give birth to children who were later diagnosed with ADHD, depression, or both. More research is needed. But these results suggest that low serotonin function can affect the brain of a woman’s developing fetus, creating ADHD-like symptoms.

 What is the risk of suicidal thoughts?
 If you were diagnosed with ADHD between the ages of 4 and 6, you may have a higher risk of becoming depressed and having suicidal thoughts later in life. Research published in JAMA Psychiatry reported that girls between 6 and 18 years old with ADHD are more likely to think about suicide than their peers without ADHD. Those with hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD are more likely to become suicidal than those with other types of the condition.
 
 Your overall risk of suicidal thoughts is still relatively low. The study director, Dr. Benjamin Lahey, notes, “Suicide attempts were relatively rare, even in the study group … more than 80 percent of the children with ADHD did not attempt suicide.”

 Suicide prevention
 If you think someone is at immediate risk of self-harm or hurting another person:
 
 Call 911 or your local emergency number.
 Stay with the person until help arrives.
 Remove any guns, knives, medications, or other things that may cause harm.
 Listen, but don’t judge, argue, threaten, or yell.
 If you think someone is considering suicide, get help from a crisis or suicide prevention hotline. Try the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.

 How can you treat ADHD and depression?
 Early diagnosis and treatment are key to managing symptoms of both ADHD and depression. If you suspect you have one condition or both, make an appointment with your doctor. They can help you develop a treatment plan that works for you.
 
 Your doctor might prescribe a combination of treatments, such as medications, behavioral therapy, and talk therapy. Some antidepressant medications can also help relieve symptoms of ADHD. For example, your doctor might prescribe imipramine, desipramine, or bupropion. They may also prescribe stimulant medications for ADHD.
 
 Behavioral therapy can help you develop coping strategies to manage your symptoms. It may help improve your focus and build your self-esteem. Talk therapy can also provide relieve for symptoms of depression and the stress of managing a chronic health condition. Leading a healthy lifestyle is also important. For example, try to get enough sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, and exercise regularly.
 
 The takeaway
 If you have ADHD, your chances of developing depression increase. If you suspect you’re experiencing depression, make an appointment with your doctor. They can help you identify the cause of your symptoms and recommend treatment.
 
 Living with ADHD and depression can be challenging, but you can take steps to manage both conditions. Your doctor may prescribe stimulant and antidepressant medications. They may also recommend counseling or other therapies.

1954,0,"Depression and Substance Abuse: The Chicken or the Egg?
 There’s a saying in the recovery movement: Alcohol and drug addiction can cause mental illness but mental illness does not cause addiction. However, some mental illnesses, especially those that are not quickly diagnosed and treated, can trigger the use of alcohol and drugs.
 
 Depressive disorders often cause acutely uncomfortable feelings such as overwhelming sadness, hopelessness, numbness, isolation, sleep disorders, digestive and food-related disorders. It is tempting, if medications aren’t being prescribed or used properly, for people suffering from depression to self-medicate.
 
 This can compound the depression and make it far worse. A drink or two, a line of cocaine or two, might temporarily relieve some symptoms, but the backlash when the chemical leaves the body brings the depression to new lows. This “withdrawal depression” happens each time an abused chemical leaves the body, though many people don’t experience severe symptoms at first. The withdrawal depression itself can trigger the use of more alcohol or drugs because they will help get rid of the bad feelings.
 
 Another compounding problem is that if drugs and alcohol are being used while medication is being taken, the alcohol or drugs can actually potentiate—make stronger—or deactivate the medication. Either way, this can put the person in medical danger.

 Because of their personal life-shattering experiences with substance abuse, some people in recovery are leery of using any drugs, even prescribed ones. They have faced traumatic experiences with addiction and have a difficult time coming to terms with the necessity for medication intervention. In fact, I have had patients who have quit drinking or drugging the hard way—through willpower or cold turkey—yet are willing to endure the horrible symptoms of depression rather than take medication. Very often their social sober support network advises them to refrain from taking meds. Usually, this is not within the realm of the advisor’s authority. Dually-diagnosed patients (those with both mental illness and addiction) should speak with their psychiatrist about this issue, not a friend, no matter how well-intentioned.
 
 
 One question I get asked frequently from addiction-treatment patients who are diagnosed with depression after they are diagnosed with an addiction is “did my drinking or drugging cause the depression?” The initial answer is always a resounding “maybe.” A well-trained psychotherapist will often be able to tease out the source of the depression and find out if it existed before the patient came in for addiction treatment. Therapists use a psychosocial evaluation and reports from family, friends, employers, court and police records and the like to help determine which condition occurred first.
 
 Why is it important to know when the depression first occurred? Because someone who had depression before they began to abuse substances will most likely need treatment, including medication intervention, for a longer period of time compared to someone whose depression was caused by the cycle of addiction. Someone whose depression was caused by substance abuse generally will not need the same treatment as someone whose depression preceded his or her substance abuse.
 
 Sometimes when someone comes in for addiction treatment and has a depressive disorder that was caused by addiction, they aren’t able to accurately report what is going on for them. They may be too numb or sad or unable to focus. Or perhaps a less-than-thorough psychosocial evaluation is done. Lack of reporting or inadequate evaluation may prevent the full understanding of whether the depressive disorder preceded or was caused by the substance abuse.
 
 If a patient whose depression was caused by chemical abuse is referred to a treatment track for those who were depressed first and chemically dependent later, within a few weeks he or she usually is asking “what am I doing here? I don’t have these kinds of problems!” In these cases this isn’t necessarily a function of denial but a valid observation due to an original lack of understanding about whether the depression or the addiction came first.

 Depression can zap your motivation and joy, make you feel worthless and exhausted, and even bring on a stream of negative or suicidal thoughts. Here are some reasons why it might happen.
 
 Adolescent Content/Erin Davis/Getty Images
 If you have depression or have watched someone go through it, you may know how debilitating it can be.
 
 When depression is severe and debilitating, some people use the term “crippling depression” to express how it’s so completely overwhelming in mind and body. But this word has been used in hurtful ways to refer to people with disabilities, so it’s best to use other ways to describe depression — like “severe” or “overwhelming.”
 
 If depression feels debilitating, there are actually a few potential conditions it could be, such as major depressive disorder, postpartum depression, or a bipolar disorder depressive episode.
 
 You’re not alone. And even if it’s hard to believe, depression is very treatable.
 
 Language matters
 While you may have landed on this page searching for “crippling depression,” many people with disabilities find the word “crippling” offensive because they feel it diminishes the impact of having a disability and contributes to ableism.
 
 According to the Center for Disability Rights, ableism is a set of beliefs or practices that devalue and discriminate against people with physical, intellectual, or psychiatric disabilities. Here at Psych Central, we stand against ableism and have chosen to avoid “crippling” throughout.
 
 What is debilitating depression?
 As explained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), major depressive disorder refers to the presence of “sad, empty, or hopeless” moods that cause cognitive and behavioral changes, and affect your ability to function.
 
 In fact, depression is the number one cause of disability in the world. According to the World Health Organization’s 2017 report, 4.4% of the global population experiences depression — that’s around 300 million people.
 
 We aren’t completely sure what causes depression, but experts believe it’s a mix of biological, social, and psychological factors.
 
 Depression can last anywhere from weeks to years. It doesn’t necessarily have to be long term to be debilitating, as shorter periods of depression can actually be more severe.
 
 Here’s a quick breakdown of the most common types of depression, which may be behind your severe depression:
 
 Major depression
 Major depressive disorder (MDD) — sometimes called clinical depression — is the most frequently diagnosed type of depression.
 
 An estimated 7% of U.S. adults (17.3 million) had at least one major depressive episode in 2017, and 68% who did had “severe impairment.”
 
 Per the DSM-5, MDD is characterized by symptoms of depression lasting at least 2 weeks (often longer) that significantly affect your ability to function. This includes at least five key symptoms:
 
 feeling sad or hopeless everyday
 sudden weight changes
 insomnia or hypersomnia
 psychomotor agitation (body tics, fidgeting, restlessness)
 fatigue or energy loss
 feeling worthless or guilty
 trouble concentrating
 recurring thoughts of death or suicide
 Postpartum depression
 Postpartum depression (aka perinatal depression) can begin during pregnancy or anytime within the first year after childbirth.
 
 According to a CDC reportTrusted Source, 13% of women surveyed (approximately 1 in 8) reported postpartum depression symptoms after a recent birth.
 
 While it’s most commonly associated with those who give birth, other people (like partners) can also have this form of depression.
 
 While having a new baby is naturally stressful and challenging, postpartum depression amplifies these feelings to an extreme degree. Symptoms can include:
 
 difficulty bonding with your baby
 crying more than usual
 feeling sad or hopeless
 being more irritable or angry than usual
 changes in appetite
 Persistent depressive disorder (formerly dysthymic disorder)
 Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is a type of chronic depression that usually lasts at least 2 years in adults and 1 year for children and teens.
 
 While PDD is similar to major depressive disorder, it typically has less severe symptoms but is longer lasting — so it can be just as debilitating.
 
 Feeling sad and hopeless for such a long period of time can wear you down, making it harder to function at work, school, or home. You might find it challenging to enjoy hobbies or time with friends, and feel pessimistic about the future.
 
 PDD is characterized by its chronic, long-term nature, which can involve:
 
 consistent low energy and fatigue
 trouble sleeping (insomnia)
 sleeping too much (hypersomnia)
 Bipolar disorder depression
 Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme shifts in mood. There are several types, each with different diagnostic criteria.
 
 Around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder during their lifetimes.
 
 Many people with bipolar disorder have depressive episodes. People with bipolar I have manic episodes, and sometimes experience depressive episodes. People with bipolar II have both hypomanic episodes (a less severe form of mania) and depressive episodes.
 
 Manic episodes are periods of heightened energy, confidence, and productivity, and might include being irritable, having trouble sleeping, and making reckless decisions.
 
 Depressive episodes in bipolar disorder have the same criteria as a major depressive episode. Some differences based on types include:
 
 When people with bipolar I have depressive episodes, they typically last at least 2 weeks.
 People with bipolar II may have mood changes that are less severe than bipolar I.
 Cyclothymia, a type of chronic bipolar disorder, can be just as debilitating as the other types but doesn’t involve severe depression. Someone usually has symptoms of hypomania and depression, but not full mood episodes.
 Those with bipolar disorder have a particularly high rate of suicide compared to the general population.

 Treatments
 Debilitating depression may seem like it will last forever, but help is available.
 
 With the right support, depression is very treatable. Often, multiple treatment options will work hand-in-hand to get you the best possible outcome.
 
 If you have depression, common treatments include:
 
 antidepressants combined with talk therapy (aka psychotherapy) — this is considered the gold standard in depression treatment
 lifestyle changes like eating more nutritious foods, exercising, or joining a support group
 self-help methods or self-care strategies
 Some people may also try herbal supplements, though none of these are FDA-approved. If you do want to add any supplements, consider reaching out to your doctor or a pharmacist first. It’s especially important if you’re already taking medications, as they may interact.
 
 If you haven’t responded to medications or several treatments, your depression may be considered treatment resistant. Don’t despair! There are still many options to explore, including:
 
 changing your medication strategy with your doctor
 using a therapy type you haven’t tried yet, or changing therapists if needed
 brain stimulation therapies like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
 ketamine therapy
 practicing new self-care techniques

 Reviewed by Emily Henderson, B.Sc.Jul 28 2021
 Virginia Tech scientists with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC have identified neural learning processes to be associated with symptoms of depression and linked improvements in these processes to improved symptoms in research participants being treated for depression.
 
 The findings, described in a study published today (11 a.m. July 28, 2021) in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Psychiatry, suggest distinct paths to depression symptoms and new mathematically guided approaches for treating clinical depression.
 
 Major depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States and can cause severe impairment, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. An estimated 7.1% of all U.S. adults have had at least one major depressive episode.
 
 Current medications and behavioral therapies are helpful, but for many people struggling with depression, existing treatments don't work well. We need to consider other possible paths to depression. These paths, or mechanisms, could point to new treatment targets to explore.""
 
 Pearl Chiu, associate professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute Computational Psychiatry Unit and study's corresponding author
 
 The scientists used computational models of brain functioning as a new way to consider mechanisms of depression. In a key discovery, the researchers found that the symptom improvements that followed cognitive behavioral therapy were related to improvements in reinforcement learning components that were disrupted prior to therapy.
 
 ""Depression is a very serious illness and a leading cause of disability in the world. We hope that our work can be a bridge between behavioral clinicians and computational scientists to more precisely identify what causes depression and new ways to treat the illness,"" said first author Vanessa Brown, a former doctoral student with Chiu in Virginia Tech's Department of Psychology and who is now an assistant professor of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh.
 
 The research team began studying a baseline group of 101 adults with and without clinical depression. A subset of the participants with depression were treated with up to 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy -- a treatment that involves learning how to identify and correct negative thought patterns.
 
 Participants with depression played a learning game during functional MRI brain scanning before and after cognitive behavioral therapy, and participants without depression played the same game at time points matched to participants who took part in cognitive behavioral therapy. The scientists used computational modeling to identify different processes that contribute to learning. They found that distinct components of learning about rewards and losses -- known as reinforcement learning -- were connected to certain symptoms of depression.

 ""Two of the most exciting parts of the findings are that people with depression learn in different ways and that these learning processes changed when depression symptoms improved after cognitive behavioral therapy. The link between the learning components and symptoms is critical,"" said Brooks King-Casas, co-author of the study and an associate professor with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and in the Department of Psychology in Virginia Tech's College of Science.
 
 The researchers say using computational models has potential to help other investigators and mental health professionals precisely identify new contributors to depression, which in turn could be new targets for therapies.
 
 ""An example is that for someone with depression, losing a few cents in the game could feel like losing several hundred dollars or the loss could be very hard to forget. These processes are different, but both affect how we learn and the choices we make,"" King-Casas said.
 
 ""We quantified some of these learning processes with computational modeling and show that they relate to depression in very different ways,"" said Chiu, who is also an associate professor of psychology in Virginia Tech's College of Science. ""The idea is similar to how stress or too much sodium can both contribute to high blood pressure, but what contributes to a particular person's hypertension could suggest whether they focus on decreasing stress or reducing salt consumption as part of treatment. Similarly, for depression, the parts of learning that contribute to a person's depression could call for different approaches to treatment.""
 
 Chiu says forming a computational understanding of how cognitive processes align with symptoms of depression is a promising approach.
 
 ""Now that we've linked specific components of learning to depression and show that they change with specific depression symptoms, perhaps we can develop new therapies that focus on adjusting these learning components as a way to reduce depression,"" she said.",,

 Research shows that depression is linked to the presence of inflammatory cytokines, in both healthy and ill patients.
 
 Evidence for the Role of Cytokines in Depression
 Cytokines play a role in brain development and function, and affect the neural circuits and transmitters within the brain, causing changes in the behavior. Evidence is accumulating that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP), are linked to idiopathic major depression.

 Again, when inflammatory cytokines are administered, or when the innate immune system is stimulated, the resulting responses aim to restore normal function by controlling infection or healing injury.  With chronic stimulation, however, or if the neurotransmitter pattern in the brain shows persistent alterations, the response may be psychiatric aberrations and depression.
 
 Patients with depression not only show a higher level of inflammatory chemicals at rest but these levels are more sensitive than usual to stressful stimuli.  IL-6 concentrations are increased and the anti-inflammatory effects of the glucocorticoid hormones following stress exposure are less pronounced.
 
 Conversely, individuals who have more marked inflammatory responses to chronic illness are more prone to develop both fatigue and depression than the general population. This includes cancers, autoimmune disorders, and HIV infection which are linked to higher cytokine levels. This suggests the link between innate immune system activation and higher rates of depression in these individuals.
 
 Thus inflammatory illnesses are more likely in individuals with high inflammatory cytokine levels in circulation, with greater risk of sickness and death due to these comorbidities than others.

 High levels of inflammatory cytokines activate some neurotransmitter pathways which reduce growth factor concentrations while producing changes in monoamines, glutamate, and other peptide transmitters. The cytokines themselves may mirror or cause environmental factors of psychiatric stress such as trauma during childhood life, stress, lack of sleep and so on, as well as being the mechanism through which genetics expresses itself as incipient depression.
 
 Chronic stress acts via physical signals such as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to increase cytokine-mediated messages that eventually lead to depression and other medical diseases. Gut bacterial alterations also produce a direct change in the behavior and growth factor levels within the brain which are not linked to circulating cytokine changes, showing the possibility of a direct link between the gut and the brain, the gut-brain axis.
 
 Cytokines can enter the brain via several pathways and recruit both endothelial and immune cells to produce more local cytokines, amplifying the effect on the brain. The depressive effect of these chemicals may be mediated by specific functional genetic polymorphisms such as one which codes for a serotonin reuptake promoter.  This is supported by the anti-depressive effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in cytokine-induced depression.
 
 Another interesting finding is that depressed patients without medical illness who do not respond to antidepressants have higher circulating inflammatory cytokine levels and CRP levels compared to responders. These patients may have traumatic childhood experiences which are later reflected into chronic inflammation and depression.
 
 Therapeutic Implications
 The importance of this knowledge is in the ability to work on developing drugs which prevent such signaling via inflammatory cytokines, as well as using other cytokines to prevent or to treat such behavioral effects. This is especially so when the patient already has known risk factors for cytokine-related depression, such as medical disease, psychosocial disturbances, or insomnia-related complaints. The administration of alpha-interferon, for instance, has been established to be associated with the development of iatrogenic depression in up to half of treated patients. This could be counteracted by more targeted interventions which alter the inflammatory response to produce clinical relief without intolerable side effects or threats to life.",,

 Have you just had a stressful event occur and been feeling low for a few weeks? You may be experiencing situational depression.

 Are you feeling overwhelmed from trying to cope with the stress? Do you find it difficult to engage in activities you did before the event happened? Sometimes, depression is tied to a particular situation or event.
 
 Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders. Situational depression, also called short-term depression, differs from major depressive disorder (clinical depression).
 
 Many stressful events could cause situational depression, including relationship problems, and significant life changes like moving to a new place. It’s normal to feel intense periods of sadness when stressful events rattle your world.
 
 Life changes can be challenging, but relief is available.
 
 What is it?
 Situational depression is a type of depression that happens because of a specific stressor or event. It’s sometimes known as short-term depression or temporary depression because it doesn’t last long term, as major depressive disorder would.
 
 Situational depression is officially called “adjustment disorder with depressed mood.”
 
 It’s considered an adjustment disorder because the person experiencing the situational depression usually is relieved of symptoms after they have adjusted to the change that caused the depression, or the stressor has been completely removed. You may also find relief from symptoms after a significant amount of time has passed.
 
 Situational depression affects both adults and children.
 
 If you’re facing a significant stress and find it challenging to cope, you may be experiencing situational depression. Coping skills and treatment may help you adjust to the stressor and find relief.
 
 Symptoms
 Symptoms of situational depression vary from person to person and may range in severity. Situational depression may include experiencing these symptoms after a stressful event:
 
 poor appetite or overeating
 decreased sleep or sleeping too much
 feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, or worthlessness
 relationship problems
 difficulty taking care of yourself
 low levels of energy
 lack of motivation
 suicidal thoughts
 sadness
 crying more than usual
 loss of interest in activities that were previously pleasurable
 trouble concentrating
 isolating
 feeling easily overwhelmed
 If you experienced a traumatic event and are experiencing intense, disturbing thoughts and feelings, this might signal acute stress disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), if the symptoms are continuing long after it’s over.
 
 This may involve having flashbacks, avoiding situations that remind you of the trauma, and feelings of detachment from others.

 Causes
 Several life events may cause situational depression. Some common stressors that can lead to situational depression include:
 
 relationship stress
 divorce
 finanical problems
 natural disaster
 health problems
 moving
 illness of a loved one
 relationship problems
 breakup
 According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), normal bereavement is not a part of the criteria for situational depression. Therefore, any person can experience the above events without developing situational depression. However, some people do, and it can be overwhelming.
 
 Situational vs. clinical depression
 Situational depression, when compared to clinical depression, is usually short term. Situational depression usually resolves when you have adjusted to the stressor that caused the symptoms.
 
 Emotional and behavioral responses to the stressor in situational depression occur within 3 months of the stressor. With situational depression, you may experience distress that is out of proportion to the severity of the stressor.
 
 Some people adjust to stressful events quickly and may not develop situational depression; however, others may experience symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. Situational depression always occurs because of a stressor.
 
 Usually, symptoms resulting from situational depression resolve within 6 months of the stressor occurring. However, occasionally, you may experience situational depression for longer than this.
 
 Treatment for situational depression is often short term, while clinical depression usually requires longer-term psychotherapeutic interventions.
 
 In addition, some people with clinical depression may experience symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. These symptoms are usually not present with situational depression.
 
 A qualified mental health professional can diagnose situational or clinical depression. You might consider speaking with a licensed counselor, social worker, or therapist.
 
 Treatments
 Situational depression is often treated with a combination of:
 
 psychotherapy
 coping skills
 sometimes medication
 Therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and solution-focused therapy can help with situational depression by teaching coping strategies and ways to manage emotions related to the stressor.
 
 CBT examines the ways that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected. With CBT, you can learn to reframe unhelpful thought patterns that lead to maladaptive coping behaviors.
 
 Solution-focused therapy is a very brief therapy that focuses on solutions rather than problems. You may consider this as one of your treatment options.
 
 Some medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may also be helpful in the treatment of severe situational depression, though not everyone needs these.
 
 Common SSRIs that are FDA approved in the treatment of depression are:
 
 Celexa
 Lexapro
 Paxil
 Prozac
 Trintellix
 Viibryd
 Zoloft
 If you consider medication, it’s essential to talk with your doctor about what medications may be right for you. It may also be helpful when discussing medications to tell your doctor any significant medical history and describe your symptoms. Being able to discuss history and symptoms can help your doctor suggest the correct medications.
 
 If you are experiencing situational depression, there are steps you can take to find relief. These include:
 
 exercise
 eating nutritious meals
 avoiding drugs and alcohol
 finding a supportive person to talk to
 identifying ways to change or eliminate the stressor
 practicing yoga
 deep breathing
 
 Next steps
 You may consider reaching out to your primary care physician or finding a therapist near you if you have symptoms of situational depression. A mental health professional such as a counselor or psychiatrist can help diagnose situational depression.
 
 You don’t have to deal with situational depression on your own. There are many resources available that can help.
 
 The Silent Superheroes podcast has many great podcasts about mental health, including Taylor’s story about situational depression here. You might find it helpful to listen to Taylor’s story.
 
 You do not have to go through this alone. Help is available through these, and many other, resources:
